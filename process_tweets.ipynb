      "\n",
      "Next, for each tweet, I'll separate the factors. The user has categorized them into positive and negative, so that's taken care of already. But looking at the content, most of these tweets are either positive or neutral in nature. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, tweets like \"rt AT_USER wall st kicks off new year on lower note\" seem to indicate concerns about the company's performance or market environment. Similarly, other tweets mention things like stock actions or activities, which don't sound negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a few tweets stand out more negatively. For instance, one says, \"apple will be the main victim of Microsoft and Google cutthroat smartp ...\" That's clearly a negative point about Apple's strategic moves, especially in tech competition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another negative tweet is \"$ aapl pre-market : apple downgraded on margin concerns ; stocks to start 2014 ...\" Here, the user is expressing disappointment about margins dropping, which directly affects the stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at all 31 tweets, while there are some positive points like stock mentions or updates, the majority of them don't show strong sentiment. Only a few are extremely negative regarding strategic moves and financial performance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the overall impact: most investors would expect Apple to stay profitable during a tough year with big competitors entering the market. The negative tweet about margins is a critical point that could cause concern. However, other tweets might suggest a positive outlook or current developments not impacting expectations significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of sentiment summary, while some tweets are neutral, especially those about stock actions or future activities, the negative points on margins and strategic moves make it seem like there's a downward pressure on Apple's performance for the year 2014. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the overall sentiment is [Negative] because while most tweets don't show strong signs of trouble, specific instances point to concerns about margins and strategic priorities that might impact future stock prices.\n",

      "Okay, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a company. The user provided a set of tweets and specified steps for analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"rt AT_USER summary of yesterday's webcast featuring $ aapl $ wynn $ goog $ lgf tradereducation options hedgingstrategies - - URL\"\n",
      "2. Same as above.\n",

      "4. iPhone users are more intelligent than samsung, blackberry and htc owners, $ aapl bbry, URL\n",
      "5. Same as the first tweet.\n",
      "6. 2013 wrap-up and trading set review - part iii, mentions $ aapl apple $ bp cnw csco csx goog hpq ibm intc ngg URL\n",
      "7. Apple screwed up big time URL $ amzn apple\n",
      "8. Same as the first tweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "From these, it seems the target stock is Apple (AAPL). Now, I'll analyze each tweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The first tweet mentions a webcast and strategies for hedging and trading options. It's not directly related to Apple's performance but more about user comments or content from someone else.\n",
      "2. Similar as above; again, unrelated to Apple.\n",
      "3. \"itv will boost apple\" likely refers to something related to IT vertical (ITV, which could be a typo for IT services or maybe a different company). This seems out of context and doesn't mention Apple directly.\n",
      "4. Talks about user sentiment towards iPhones being more intelligent compared to others. This relates to the market and user opinions but not specific Apple performance metrics.\n",
      "5. Repeating the first tweet's content, so no new information here.\n",
      "6. Discusses a 2013 trading review, which is not relevant to current stock price trends of Apple.\n",
      "7. \"Apple screwed up big time\" likely refers to an event that negatively impacts Apple, possibly in their business operations or market perception.\n",
      "8. Similar to the first tweet; no direct connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the factors and sentiment:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Positive Factors: Any tweets mentioning positive news about Apple could boost investor confidence and increase stock price.\n",
      "- Negative Factors: If a tweet mentions Apple's performance (like a great year, success in a specific sector) or if it suggests negative developments affecting their stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each tweet:\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I'll look at the target stock symbol from the tweets. It seems like several tweets mention AAPL, so that's my starting point. Now, for each tweet, I need to separate them into Positive and Negative factors, assess the sentiment towards investors, and then summarize overall sentiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with tweet 1: \"rt AT_USER our top 3 trade ideas for 2014 and two $ 1,000 futures wins already in the bank $ gld $ usu $ aapl - - URL\". The factors here seem neutral because it's just listing the stock names without any positive or negative indicators. I'll note that as Neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next tweet 2: \"the five-year-old ipad : when will people stop upgrading ? $ aapl github aapl URL\". This seems to be about Apple's performance, but the mention of GitHub isn't relevant here. The tweet is somewhat vague and doesn't indicate strong sentiment towards or against AAPL. So I'll mark this as Neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 3: \"$ aapl was below this level two weeks ago , and then jumped to 570 the following week ( chl news ) . earnings run up will be next catalyst \". This tweet is discussing Apple's stock price movement from below a certain level, which could indicate potential for a positive or neutral response. The phrase \"next catalyst\" suggests something upcoming might drive changes in sentiment. I'll tentatively mark this as Neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 4: \"$ aapl apple sale : best buy temporarily cuts iphone 5s price URL\". Here, Apple is selling its iPhone 5s and suggesting it's the best bet for a discount price. This seems to suggest that investors might be interested in purchasing iPhones at a lower price point, which could lead to gains. I'll mark this as Positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 5: \"rt AT_USER also added $ aapl common here w 541 stop\". The tweet mentions Apple stock trading below $541 and the user is stopping the trade. This seems like selling pressure on the stock, which could indicate negative sentiment if holders are selling off their positions. I'll mark this as Negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 6: \"rt AT_USER google's dirty secret : android phones are basically used as dumbphones $ aapl $ goog by AT_USER URL\". This tweet discusses Apple's use of Android phones for dumbphones and refers to Google's secret. There's no direct mention of Apple's stock performance, but it might be seen as a distraction or unrelated information. I'll mark this as Neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 7: \"$ bbry $ aapl blackberry files suit against typo : full story URL\". This one seems to be discussing Apple's Android devices being used for dumbphones and Google's secret, which doesn't relate directly to the stock price of Apple. So, it might not have any impact on AAPL. I'll mark this as Neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 8: \"rt AT_USER hmm not so much for $ aapl .. we got this double top threat goin on here ..\". This tweet is expressing disappointment about Apple's stock performance and mentioning a double top scenario where they're vulnerable to price corrections. If the stock is about to drop, it could lead to negative sentiment because investors might be worried about future declines. I'll mark this as Negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 9: \"rt AT_USER AT_USER what i like about $ aapl long term is its ~ 9.5 pe ex-cash gives it a floor on valuation . only hi quality s …\". This tweet seems to express positive sentiment towards Apple's technical analysis and future growth potential based on P/E ratio. It suggests the stock could grow, so I'll mark this as Positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 10: \"$ aapl is soooo pathetic . one has to wonder if icahn is selling . 544 must hold .\". This tweet is very negative about Apple's performance and mentions investor interest in keeping CEO Carol Dweck. It seems like strong negative sentiment here because Apple isn't doing well and investors are cautious. I'll mark this as Negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 11: \"rt AT_USER 50 % of trades in $ aapl today are for less than 100 shares oddlots\". This is about trading activity on the stock, specifically mentioning that 50% of trades are under 100 shares. It's more of a general trading perspective rather than directly affecting stock price. I'll mark this as Neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 12: \"the good support for $ aapl today is 541.02 URL\". This tweet refers to Apple's current stock price and mentions \"good support.\" Again, it's more about the current state of trading rather than affecting the future stock price. So, I'll mark this as Neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 13: \"rt AT_USER our top 3 trade ideas for 2014 and two $ 1,000 futures wins already in the bank $ gld $ usu $ aapl - - URL\". Similar to tweet 1, it's listing stock names without any positive or negative cues. I'll mark this as Neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 14: \"b bloggers trading $ aapl stupid again nsa ‘ malicious hackers ’ & then ? before it becomes farce maybe next try to parse what ‘ any ’ means & when\". This tweet is more of a speculative trading tip and doesn't provide direct information about Apple's stock. It seems like just speculation without impact on the stock price, so I'll mark this as Neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 15: \"rt AT_USER our top 3 trade ideas for 2014 and two $ 1,000 futures wins already in the bank $ gld $ usu $ aapl - - URL\". Again, listing stock names without sentiment. Marked as Neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 16: \"also referring to tweet 15: rt AT_USER another one from user @1549848170\" – seems like a repetition or mention of the same tweet. It doesn't provide new information or impact on AAPL's stock price, so I'll mark this as Neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 17: \"also referring to tweet 16: rt AT_USER another one from user @1549848170\" – same thing repeated. Marked as Neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, tweets 18-23 are about Apple's stock performance and investor sentiment. I'll need to analyze these to determine their impact. However, since the user hasn't provided tweet content for tweets 18-23 yet, I can only comment on what's available. The ones after tweet 17 are about the user interacting with the previous tweet, so they're not part of the main stream data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, some tweets might have strong positive or negative impacts based on their wording and context. I'll categorize them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative accordingly.\n",

      "   - **Reason**: Expresses disappointment about Apple's performance and mentions investor interest in maintaining CEO Carol Dweck.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Tweet 10**: \n",
      "   - **Sentiment**: Negative\n",
      "   - **Reason**: Describes the stock as \"soooo pathetic\" (very negative) with a focus on cautious investors due to strong growth expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Tweet 9**: \n",
      "   - **Sentiment**: Positive\n",
      "   - **Reason**: Highlights Apple's technical analysis and future potential based on P/E ratio, suggesting growth potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Tweet 14-23**:\n",
      "   - **Sentiment**: Neutral\n",

      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of Apple Inc. Let me break it down step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, the most common one is \"aapl,\" which stands for Apple Inc. So that's my target stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, for each tweet, I have to separate the factors into Positive and Negative. Then assess the sentiment towards investor sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the first tweet: \"$ aapl - boeing contract with machinists - details of agreement -> URL stock stocks stockaction\". The words \"boeing\" and \"machinists\" are mentioned, but it doesn't specify whether they're positive or negative. It's just stating information about a contract without any sentiment indication.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second tweet is \"claytrader : * * $ aapl video chart 1/3 / 14 * * : claytrader URL.\" The presence of \"claytrader\" is unclear and not providing much insight into sentiment. It's just listing some details about the stock, so probably neutral or positive, but I'm not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third tweet says: \"rt AT_USER january 3 , 1977 – steve jobs and steve wozniak incorporated apple computer company . $ aapl.\" This seems genuine, mentioning Steve Jobs and Wozniak. It's talking about the incorporation of Apple in January 1977, which is significant because Steve Jobs was a major figure in Apple's early days.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth tweet: \"apple iwatch reportedly already in production URL ibdblogs via AT_USER $ aapl $ qcom $ sne $ nke.\" This one mentions that the iPhone iWatch is being produced. That would be positive because it shows that the product is viable and moving towards market approval, which is good for Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth tweet: \"apple stock forecast : playing $ aapl - s & p 500 spread as “ market neutral ” strategy . | URL $ spy.\" This seems to provide a financial outlook, indicating a negative sentiment since it suggests the company is betting on a negative market trend. This would likely lead people to sell their Apple stocks, so that's negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, putting this together:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Positive tweets: The third tweet mentions Steve Jobs and Wozniak, which is positive because it builds credibility.\n",
      "- Neutral or Mixed: The first tweet doesn't indicate sentiment; the second isn't enough information. The fourth tweet about iWatch production supports the stock positively.\n",
      "- Negative tweets: Third tweet's incorporation of Steve Jobs could be seen as a positive event for Apple, but maybe not necessarily positive in all contexts? Wait, \"incorporated\" is neutral because it just describes a fact without emotion. But I'm not sure if that's positive or negative.\n",
      "- The fifth tweet is definitely negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the third tweet is about incorporation; does that mean Apple was acquired by Steve Jobs at some point, which might have affected their future performance? It could be a positive sign because it shows they're part of a major company, but maybe not necessarily a selling point for new investors. The fourth tweet's production of the iWatch is definitely a selling point.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let me recount:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Incorporation tweet: Neutral (just fact)\n",
      "2. Iwatch production: Positive\n",
      "3. Stock forecast: Negative\n",
      "\n",
      "Neutral overall? Or positive because they're adding more positive points?\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall sentiment for Apple Inc.'s stock based on the given tweets is [Positive].\n",
      "Finished processing: 2014-01-04, Sentiment: Positive\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Apple (AAPL). Let me go through each tweet one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "First tweet says: \"$ aapl machinists vote helps boeing avoid hiring crunch URL\". Hmm, that doesn't look like real information. It sounds like some kind of joke or prediction from people. The word \"boeing\" might be a typo for \"hiring,\" so maybe it's about the company avoiding a crunch by hiring more workers. If they're suggesting a positive outcome related to productivity, that could be seen as a good sign. But sometimes fake news can lead to mixed reactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second tweet: \"$ aapl jim , the ' great ' jim ghostine has predicted $425 for AAPL what says u ? . target = $ 425 URL\". This looks like another made-up prediction or quote from someone, possibly Jim with a ghost name. If they're predicting a specific price point and offering their opinion, it's speculative. It could be positive, negative, or neutral depending on how realistic the numbers are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third tweet: \"$ aapl forecasting apple using evidence-driven technical analysis (subscribers only ) . target = $ 425 URL\". This seems like a prediction based on technical analysis, which is a data-driven approach. Apple often relies on this kind of analysis, especially for stock prices. If they're making an update or forecast with subscriber access, it could indicate confidence in the company's future performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth tweet: \"$ spy $ fb $ aapl $ target = $ 425 URL\". This seems like a list of symbols and some number. It might be suggesting that these companies are targeting $425 each or something related to their stock prices. It doesn't specify how, but sometimes investors look at multiple stocks for diversification or to see if they're heading in the right direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together: Each tweet seems to offer a prediction, either from a real person or a made-up quote. Predictions can be positive, negative, or neutral depending on whether they contribute positively to investor confidence. But given that many of these tweets are speculative and not backed by credible sources, it's hard to tell if their impact is significant or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think each tweet is providing some information but without real data supporting them, so the overall sentiment might be neutral because there's uncertainty involved.\n",
