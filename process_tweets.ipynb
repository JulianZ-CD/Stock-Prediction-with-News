      "<think>\n",
      "Alright, so I have to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on a stock's future price for a given company, like Apple (AAPL). Let me go through each tweet one by one and analyze them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the first tweet: It says Wall Street kicks off a new year on \"lower note.\" That might suggest some bad news, but it's vague. The word \"kicks off\" could be positive or negative depending on context. Maybe not enough info to decide yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second tweet mentions Apple making a huge push into healthcare. I'm not sure if this is good or bad for the stock. Healthcare being a separate industry might affect Apple's performance, but it's speculative without more information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third tweet talks about trade ideas and gains for 2014 with $1,000 wins. Positive trades could indicate success, but if they're in the bank, maybe the overall market is down, which might not directly impact Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth tweet refers to something about breathing difficulties. That seems unusual and unlikely to be a major factor influencing Apple's stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth tweet says that companies like Emylers are updating their boards. No info on Apple here, so probably neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixth tweet mentions Blackberry and singer Alicia Keys leaving. Again, no information on Apple, just unrelated news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seventh tweet is positive for China's Xiaomi, but how does that affect Apple? Unless it's a strategic move, maybe not significant enough to impact the stock price directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eighth tweet says nothing about Apple's top picks in Q1 2014. Without data on what they picked, it's hard to gauge the sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ninth and tenth tweets are repeating similar phrases, which might be promotional but without specific information on Apple, I can't assess them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twelfth tweet mentions a stock being on Wall Street for a new year, which could indicate some underlying factors that influence price movements. But again, vague info.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirteenth tweet is positive about an 8% increase in 2013 compared to the S&P's 30%. Apple had better performance in 2014 than last year, but without context on market conditions or other factors, it's unclear if that affects their stock price for 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourteenth tweet talks about trade ideas, similar to others. Not enough info.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifteenth tweet is repeating the same positive statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixteenth and seventeenth tweets are negative for Apple because they predict Microsoft and Google will cut margins. If margins are lower, it could lead to lower stock prices in the short term, but long-term performance isn't clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seventeenth tweet discusses supply/demand zones, price patterns, etc., which might indicate future events affecting Apple's stock. It seems more of an industry trend analysis rather than a direct stock impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eighteenth and nineteenth tweets are promotional for an app (Spy) that relates to tech companies. No info on Apple here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twentieth tweet mentions cleaning the mobile germ warehouse, which is a business move but not directly related to Apple's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty-first tweet introduces a company's name (Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg launching products), which might be unrelated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty-second tweet talks about 2014 being an \"year of innovation,\" implying that it could be a good time for tech stocks. But without specific information on trends or market conditions, it's speculative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty-third tweet mentions margin concerns leading to a stock downgrade targeting Cantor's top large cap pick. This directly affects Apple's stock price, as Apple is one of the largest companies in the US, so this would likely have a negative impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty-four and twenty-five tweets are positive about the stock during the week, which could indicate good market sentiment or positive news for Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "So overall, I notice that some tweets are directly mentioning specific events affecting Apple's performance. The 23rd tweet talks about margin concerns, which is a major factor in stock prices. Additionally, several other tweets like Q2 and the following weeks point to an \"year of innovation,\" which could be positive if it's good news for the company. But I also see some negative tweets related to margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while there are mixed signals regarding Apple's performance in 2014, especially around margins, the overall sentiment seems influenced by both positive trends (23rd tweet) and potential negative factors (negative tweets). This makes it a bit ambiguous but leans more towards a positive trend because innovation can drive growth.\n",

      "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Apple's stock price impact on their future stock price. The user provided some tweets and wants me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative, then give an overall sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through them, I see a few mentions of Apple with the symbol \"aapl\". That's the one I should focus on for my analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I'll go tweet by tweet and break down each one into factors and sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The first tweet is an AT_USER summary of yesterday's webcast about traders hedging strategies. It doesn't specify anything new or negative, just an update from a trader. So it's neutral because it's neither positive nor negative in any significant way.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Same as the first one—it's another traders' webcast summary with no specific trends or issues. So again, this is neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Third tweet says \"itv will boost apple URL $ aapl apple\". The word \"URL\" might be part of an address, but I'm not sure what it stands for here. It just mentions boosting Apple's stock price. That seems positive because it's indicating a potential increase, which could affect the stock price positively.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Fourth tweet is comparing the intelligence of iPhone users with others like Samsung, Blackberry, and Htc. It doesn't mention anything about the company itself or its stock performance. This could be neutral or even negative depending on how the user interprets it, but I'll consider it as neutral because there's no explicit mention of Apple's stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Fifth tweet is another traders' webcast summary with a bit of text. No significant positive or negative info here; just an update from traders. So that's neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Sixth tweet talks about the 2013 trading set review, but it includes prices for various companies, not Apple. It mentions things like BP and CSCO and others. This is more about market trends rather than the company itself. Maybe slightly negative because of potential future issues, but I'm not entirely sure if that's enough to be considered positive or neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Seventh tweet says \"apple screwed up big time URL $ amzn $ aapl\". The word \"URL\" again might refer to Amazon, and this seems to indicate Apple is having an issue. That would make sense because it's related to the company and could affect its stock price positively if things go well. However, sometimes issues can lead to negative sentiment even if there's potential for improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Similar to tweet 4, this one is just a traders' webcast summary without any specific mention of Apple or its performance. So neutral again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, combining all these tweets:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Tutorials and updates from traders are generally positive because they're just sharing information.\n",
      "- The third tweet mentions boosting Apple's stock price—this seems like a strong positive signal suggesting potential gains.\n",
      "- The sixth tweet is about market reviews but doesn't directly relate to Apple. It might have some negative aspects, but not enough to outweigh the positive factors from the third tweet.\n",
      "- The seventh tweet talks about Apple messing up big time, which could be seen as a risk or concern for investors, which might lead to a slightly negative sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since the overall trend is dominated by the boosting statement in tweet 3 and a potential concern in tweet 7, but not enough evidence from other tweets that are neutral. I think the positive sentiment from tweet 3 outweighs the uncertainty, so overall it's positive.\n",

      "Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets about Apple's stock price trends over time. Let me go through each tweet step by step and see what they're saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with tweet 1: It mentions $ aapl kicks off the new year on a lower note. That sounds negative because it seems like the stock is doing well despite starting low. So that's a negative thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 2 talks about Apple pushing into healthcare, which is positive because it suggests expansion in a growing market area. But since it's related to Apple's own products, maybe the sentiment is mixed but more positive overall for the company itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 3 has multiple mentions of Apple making $1,000 futures wins with gains on the stock. That sounds like significant profits, which is positive news for investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 4 says the price is breathing difficulties and doesn't cry about long-term investments. So that's a mix—some good and some uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 5 discusses top trades for Q1 and mentions current company activities. This seems neutral because it's just talking about actions without stating much about the stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets 6,7,8,9 all mention Apple's performance in tech companies or maybe other unrelated topics. The word 'blackberry' is in there, which isn't related to Apple, so this might be negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet10 asks for top picks in Q1, which could either be positive if people are looking to buy Apple stock or neutral if it's just a call.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets 11,12,13,14 all discuss Apple gaining margin but not crying about the future. So they're more about current performance rather than overall sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets15,16: Both talk about margins and Apple being a victim of Microsoft and Google. That suggests that Apple might be struggling financially in this space, which could make investors nervous—negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet17 mentions supply/demand zones, price patterns, and investment trends. This is more technical analysis, so it's likely neutral since it doesn't provide sentiment info on the stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets 18 and 20 talk about buying a TV for Apple and cleaning a mobile germ warehouse. These seem like unrelated ideas, so they might be just filler or speculative but don't directly impact Apple's stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets21 mentions launches of re/.code projects with Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg. This is more promotional content, which could be seen as positive if the company is trying to expand or innovate, but not necessarily directly about the stock's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet22 talks about Apple downgrading due to margin concerns and a price target for 2014. This is news that can affect investor sentiment positively once announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets23 and25 mention updates on margins and future stock prices, which could push investors into positive territory if the company shows improved financial health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets26 talks about daily chart ranges for $aapl, which might be an unrelated analysis but doesn't provide a direct impact on the stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet27 discusses analyst opinions from Zacks on other companies but doesn't mention Apple's stock directly. So maybe neutral since it's just quotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets28,30: Both talk about margin concerns and future plans for margins. If Apple is struggling with margins, that could lead to a negative impact on the stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, putting this all together: There are some positive tweets like 2,7,16,23,25,29 which point to potential improvements in margins or expansion. However, other tweets (-2,-4) mention Microsoft/Google and Apple's victimship of competitors and financials.

      "\n",
      "Tweet 3 mentions China's Xiaomi plans to double smartphone sales. That’s a negative point for Apple because Chinese tech companies are often a competitive threat. So that's probably negative for Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 4 says how Apple has breathing difficulties. Breathing issues in the stock could indicate poor performance, maybe even negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 5 is about company activities and other updates on a stock website. Without specific stock names or details, it's hard to assess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 6 links stocks with a new event— Wall Street kicks off on a lower note. Not directly related to Apple, so not relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 7 says China’s Xiaomi will double smartphone sales in 2014. Definitely a negative because it's a direct threat and could hurt Apple's sales. This tweet is strong, so it should be considered as negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets 8,9,10 are about choosing top picks for Q1 stock prices. These are about the company’s future performance, not specific to stocks. So overall positive or neutral since they don't mention stock performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets 11,12,13,14 all talk about trade ideas and analysts' opinions on tech companies like Microsoft, Google, etc., so no impact on Apple's stock directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets 15,16 are about cleaning a mobile germ warehouse. Not related to stocks at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets 17-20 discuss margins and analyst comments for Apple and other tech firms. Margins can affect profit but not necessarily the price unless it's due to competition. So some negative impact on margins, which could reduce stock value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 21 mentions launching re/Code projects with Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg. These are business developments unrelated to Apple's stock performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweets 22-30 focus on margin concerns leading to a downgrade or sales targets. This is about future performance affecting stock price, which could be negative if the management expects lower margins.\n",

      "After considering all the tweets, the most significant negative factors seem to be China’s Xiaomi sales and margin concerns. These directly impact Apple's revenue and profitability.

      "\n",
      "Second tweet: claytrader : * * $ aapl video chart 1/3 / 14 * * : claytrader URL. This one looks like a link or perhaps some kind of informational content. I don't know if it relates to the stock directly, and it's unclear what it might influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third tweet: rt AT_USER january 3 , 1977 – steve jobs and steve wozniak incorporated apple computer company . $ aapl. This sounds like a historical note from January 3, 1977, about Steve Jobs and the incorporation of Apple. I remember that Steve Jobs did make a lot of money from his company during that time. Maybe this could be a positive or negative factor if it affects future plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth tweet: apple iwatch reportedly already in production URL ibdblogs via AT_USER $ aapl $ qcom $ sne $ nke. This mentions an iWatch being produced and also lists other stocks. The word \"already\" suggests that the company is moving forward, which might imply positive news about their product's success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth tweet: apple stock forecast : playing $ aapl - s & p 500 spread as “ market neutral ” strategy . | URL $ spy. This talks about an investment strategy focusing on the S&P 500 spread as \"market neutral.\" That sounds like a strategic decision by Apple, which could mean they're considering future movements in their portfolio or stock prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to analyze each tweet for positive, negative, or neutral factors and overall sentiment. The first two tweets don't seem directly related. The third is about history; not sure how relevant. Fourth mentions production of a product, which could be good news. Fifth talks about a strategy, suggesting they might take certain risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the fourth tweet points to an ongoing development that could have positive impact on their stock price. The fifth tweet is strategic but might not directly affect immediate prices but hint at future actions. Combining these, it seems like there's some positive information suggesting good news ahead.\n",
      "</think>\n",

      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user has provided four tweets and wants me to assess each one's impact using a score of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let me go through each tweet step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \" $ aapl machinists vote helps boeing avoid hiring crunch URL\"\n",
      "2. \" AT_USER jim , the \" great \" AT_USER ghostine has predicted $ 425 for $ aapl what says u ? . target = $ 425 URL\"\n",
      "3. \" $ aapl ... forecasting apple using evidence-driven technical analysis ( subscribers only ) . target = $ 425 URL\"\n",
      "4. \" rt AT_USER here are the 100 most popular and most trending stocks of the last year URL $ spy $ fb $ aapl\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From these, it seems like the main stock involved is APL or Apple in some contexts. Wait, in tweet 4, it's listing spy (which I know is SPY, the S&P 500 ETF), and FB and APL as other stocks from the last year. Hmm, maybe all of them are related? Or perhaps each tweet mentions a different stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, for tweet 1, it mentions \"APL\" but also talks about the \"hiring crunch,\" which might be referring to the company's strategic decisions affecting their workforce. That could influence investor sentiment and thus the stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 2 is from an AT_USER whose name includes both \"jim\" (a business leader) and \"ghostine.\" They're making a prediction about Apple's stock reaching $425. The use of \"great\" suggests they're optimistic, which might be positive but could also indicate fear if the number seems low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 3 is also from AT_USER predicting that Apple will reach $425 for their stock. It mentions evidence-driven technical analysis and has \"subscribers only,\" which might imply that the information source is a paid service, adding credibility or potential downside if the tech isn't reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet 4 lists several stocks: SPY (which I know is SPY is Apple's ETF), FB (Facebook), and APL (App Store) stock. Each of these has been discussed before in other tweets. For example, tweet 1 could be about a strategy affecting APL, and tweets from previous users might have more detailed predictions or analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Tweet 1 mentions the hiring crunch for APL, which could affect their performance.\n",
      "- Tweets 2 and 3 both predict Apple reaching $425. Both are positive in predicting a specific target price but may be seen as cautious moves given that the prediction is exact.\n",
      "-Tweet 4 lists other stocks with more varied analysis, some positive (like predicting FB's stock) and others negative (SPY could have been a sell-off if it drops).\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, all these tweets seem to focus on Apple or related ETFs like SPY. So maybe each tweet is a separate analysis about different aspects of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering each:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The hiring crunch for APL might cause stock price to drop as employees are affected.\n",
      "2. Predicting a specific target price could lead to uncertainty, which can be positive if investors expect improvement but negative if they're worried it's too low.\n",
      "3. Using technical analysis with subscribers suggests credibility and perhaps more risk if the data is outdated or flawed.\n",
      "4. Mentioning multiple stocks implies different perspectives; some might see them as undervalued or overvalued.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, since all tweets are about predicting Apple's stock price in the near future, they seem to be focused on a single target. The sentiment would depend on whether the predictions are positive (like targetting $425) or negative, and whether it affects investor confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, tweet 3 seems very confident with specific numbers and technical analysis, which might boost the stock if investors believe the analyst is well-informed. But tweet 1, the hiring crunch, could be a factor leading to some price movement even if the predictions are positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, without more context on how these tweets were shared (whether they're news articles, tweets about earnings, etc.), it's challenging to assess their impact precisely. \n",
      "\n",
      "But considering that multiple tweets mention predicting Apple stock at $425, which seems specific and could lead investors to think Apple is expected to reach a certain price, but the exactness might indicate some level of fear or uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in summary, each tweet contributes to the analysis, but without knowing how they were presented (e.g., whether it's an analyst update), it's hard to pin down the overall impact. However, given that tweets 2 and 3 are both predicting Apple at $425, which is a significant number, it might suggest a cautious tone with positive sentiment towards Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in tweet 1, the mention of a hiring crunch could either be positive or negative depending on the context. A \"hiring crunch\" often refers to economic uncertainty about layoffs or increased employment, which can affect profitability and stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if all tweets are focused on predicting Apple's performance, perhaps they're all leaning towards a positive sentiment because the predictions are specific and likely seen as reassurance for investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, combining these thoughts, I'd say the overall impact is Positive.\n",
