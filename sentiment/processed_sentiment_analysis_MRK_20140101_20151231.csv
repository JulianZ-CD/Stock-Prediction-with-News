2014-01-01,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets about stock prices for a given company. Let me start by looking at each tweet and figuring out what's going on.

First, I see symbols like dow stocks trend $ axp $ utx etc., which probably mean the stock symbol is ""axp."" Then there are other stocks mentioned: utx, csco, ko, hd, dis, v, ibm, dd, intc, jpm, unh, trv, mrk, mmm, ge, gs, msft, cat. Hmm, some of these might be related to the target company or just general stock movements.

The user is asking about their impact on a given company's future stock price, but the exact company isn't specified in the tweets provided. That complicates things because each tweet could affect any number of companies, not just one. Without knowing which stock they're referring to, it's hard to assess the sentiment.

I should probably mention that without additional context or information about the specific stock being referred to, I can't accurately determine its impact on its own future price. It's possible these tweets are part of a broader market analysis or could be related to different stocks, so each tweet might have varying effects depending on their content and context.

I should consider if there's any trend or news in the tweets that relates to the company. For example, if many tweets mention increased earnings, positive trends, or upcoming events, that could indicate a positive sentiment for the stock. Conversely, negative news like drops in dividends, economic downturns, or regulatory issues might signal negativity.

But since I don't know which stock these tweets pertain to, my analysis is limited. It's important to advise that without specific context about the target company and its financial health, it's challenging to assign a sentiment label. The user should provide more details or specify the stock in question so I can offer a more accurate assessment.

In conclusion, because each tweet might affect multiple stocks, and the exact company isn't specified, my answer is limited. However, I can explain that without knowing which stock we're focusing on and its current status, it's impossible to determine if the overall sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative."

2014-01-03,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about stock prices and determine whether they'll impact the future stock price of a company. The user provided specific instructions on how to process each tweet: extract the stock symbol, analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors, assess sentiment, then combine all that into an overall sentiment.

Looking at the example given, it's pretty straightforward—each tweet is about different stocks with various symbols. But in the output, the user wrote the first tweet as "" weekly dow stocks trend $ dis $ wmt $ hd $ gs $ v $ intc $ ibm $ utx $ vz $ unh $ t $ msft $ axp $ jpm $ mrk $ csco $ ko $ cvx @ URL"" and concluded with ""[Positive]"".

Wait, but that's just one tweet. The user provided only one tweet in the input, right? Let me check again.

The tweets section shows a single line with a bunch of stock symbols: dow stocks trend $ dis $ wmt $ hd $ gs $ v $ intc $ ibm $ utx $ vz $ unh $ t $ msft $ axp $ jpm $ mrk $ csco $ ko $ cvx @ URL. That's one tweet, so I should analyze this single tweet.

The goal is to determine the overall impact on a company's future stock price. So for each symbol in that line, I need to check if it's positive or negative. Wait, but I don't have specific context about which company these symbols represent—like dow stocks trend $ dis. That could be either Dow stocks going up or down, depending on the interpretation.

Hold on, maybe I misread. Let me think again. The user provided a single tweet with several stock symbols and mentions some other symbols like @URL. But without knowing what each symbol stands for, it's hard to assess their impact on any specific company's stock price. For example, $dis could be Dilip Sangleen, or $wmt is WMT Corporation, etc.

So perhaps the task is just about identifying if the tweet has positive, negative, or neutral sentiment overall? But that seems too broad because the tweet includes multiple stocks and symbols which might not all be related to one company. Maybe I'm supposed to assume each symbol relates to a different company but then only analyze their specific impact on their own stock?

Alternatively, maybe it's about analyzing the overall market trend based on these symbols—like if they are talking about Dow stocks moving in some direction.

Wait, perhaps the user wants me to recognize that each of those symbols could be representing individual companies, so the tweet is providing a general view or analysis for several stocks. But without knowing which stock it's referring to, I can't make an accurate prediction.

Hmm, maybe the task is more about evaluating each tweet in isolation and considering if they contribute positively, negatively, or neutrally to the market. Since there's only one tweet, perhaps I need to evaluate whether this tweet provides any information that could affect a specific company's stock price, but since it includes multiple stocks with different symbols, it might be misleading.

Alternatively, maybe it's about identifying if these tweets collectively suggest an overall positive or negative trend across multiple companies. But without context on which company each symbol represents, I can't do that either.

Wait, perhaps the tweet is a list of stock symbols from various companies, but without more context, it's impossible to determine their impact on any specific stock price.

Is there another way? Maybe the user wants me to think that each stock symbol here could be referring to different companies, and thus this tweet doesn't provide enough information for one specific company. So perhaps the overall sentiment is neutral because we can't determine how each individual stock will perform based solely on this tweet.

Alternatively, maybe the tweet is a general statement about the market or financials, which might indicate some positive or negative trends that could affect multiple companies but individually may not have enough data to predict their specific stock price movement.

Given all that uncertainty, perhaps the safest conclusion is that since each symbol likely refers to different companies and we can't know their individual performance from this tweet alone, the overall sentiment would be neutral. So the output would be [Neutral]."

2014-01-06,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. So, first, I see there's a tweet about FDA opening an advertisement component with a 3-day CRDC. It mentions reading it at the US Capitol Capsule URL and links to several stocks: pharma, biotech, biopharma, $ mrk $ chtp $ jnj.

Okay, starting with identifying the target stock symbol. The user is referring to FMDC, I think. They mention a 3-day CRDC, which likely stands for something like Customer Relationship Management or something related to compliance, given the mention of pharma and biotech companies involved. So, the target stock here would probably be FMDC.

Next, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions FDA opening an adcomms (which I think stands for advertisement management) with a 3-day CRDC. It says to read it on the US Capitol Capsule URL and link to $ mrk $ chtp $ jnj. So, this tweet is about introducing something new or advancing their product line.

Now, analyzing factors. The first part talks about FMDC opening adcomms, which could be a positive sign because it's an advancement in the company's product development. It mentions reading it on Capitol Capsule, which might suggest they're prioritizing compliance as well, but that seems more like a positive action rather than a negative factor.

But wait, why is FMDC linked to pharma and biotech? Maybe it's about their supply chain or regulatory solutions. That could be either good or bad depending on context. If this is related to the company's operations, especially in pharma, that might be beneficial because pharmaceutical companies rely heavily on efficient supply chains.

But also, FMDC being associated with customer relationship management (CRDC) implies they might be integrating digital elements into their marketing and sales processes. This could be a positive strategic move for both brand loyalty and customer engagement. However, if this isn't in line with the company's core business, it might have drawbacks.

Looking at sentiment: The tweet mentions ""read about it at us capitol capsule URL"" which is an action taken to advance their product, so that sounds positive. The link to pharma companies suggests they're supporting the supply chain, which can be a plus. But the mention of regulatory components could sometimes indicate issues like compliance with strict regulations, but in this case, it's about innovation.

So, considering all factors: advancing product development, integrating customer relationship management (which is good for marketing and brand), and possibly supporting pharma companies. Since these are positive aspects, even if there are regulatory considerations, the main impact here is on innovation and supply chain efficiency.

Additionally, since they're reading it at a specific URL related to Capitol Capsule, which might be a significant event or official document, this could indicate that the tweet is from someone with knowledge, adding credibility. The link to pharma companies suggests there's potential for collaboration or support in the supply chain, which is generally positive.

Therefore, putting it all together: The tweet introduces FMDC as an advancement, supports pharma and biotech companies through their product development, integrates customer relationship management (which is a plus), and provides links to relevant stocks. There's no explicit negative mention, but the potential for regulatory compliance isn't clearly negative here.

So, overall sentiment should be positive."
2014-01-07,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price. The user provided a list of tweets where each one is either positive, negative, or neutral about a specific stock. But wait, looking at the tweets, the target stock isn't specified here. Hmm, that could be an issue because without knowing which stock we're talking about, it's hard to assess its impact on the actual market.

Let me read through the tweets again:

1. $ fslr $ aapl $ mu $ c $ ma $ yoku $ sd $ mrk $ v active equity options trading on open : full story URL

I notice that some of these symbols like APPL (which is Apple) are present, and others like SQ, V, MRK, etc., which are known stocks. But without knowing the exact stock being referred to here, I can't accurately evaluate its impact on the overall market. 

First, I need to make sure I'm interpreting each tweet correctly. The words ""fslr"" and ""mu"" might be acronyms or part of the company's name, but it's unclear. ""Yoku"" could refer to something like YOKO stock, which is related to semiconductor companies like LG Corporation.

However, without knowing the specific stock symbol in each tweet, I can't determine if the message positively, neutrally, or negatively affects its performance. For example, an active equity options trading might indicate investor interest or confidence in the company's future prospects. But again, without context about what the stock symbol represents, it's challenging.

Since all the tweets don't specify which stock they're talking about, I think the safest approach is to state that I can't determine the impact because the target stock isn't provided. It would be best if each tweet was tied to a specific company for an accurate analysis.

So, maybe the user intended to provide more context or include the target stock in each tweet. If that's not possible here, I'll have to inform them about this limitation and suggest how they can provide more details."
2014-01-08,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price for a biotech company called Mrk. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk this overvalued biotech is in danger of plummeting as much as 30 % URL"". This seems negative because it's mentioning a significant drop and says they're overvalued. So that should probably be a Negative sentiment.

Next, the second tweet: ""$ xncr is eligible for up to $ 1.3 b milestone paymts from partnerships w $ mor $ amgn $ alxn $ jnj $ csl.ax $ mrk bi [ wedbush ] URL"". This one says there are potential payments of up to $1.3 billion, which seems positive because it's a financial incentive for the company. It's talking about milestones and potential payouts, which generally increase investor confidence.

Now, I need to analyze both tweets. The first is clearly negative regarding the stock price. The second is positive in terms of future incentives but doesn't mention anything specific about the stock itself. So overall, there are both bad news and good news, but the primary sentiment seems like a mixed bag with some bad info and some positive potential."
2014-01-09,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given tweet will positively affect the stock price of the company, be neutral, or negatively impact it. The stock symbol here is mrk, which I think stands for Markups Reactitive, but maybe that's not important right now.

Looking at the tweet: ""mrk bristol myers squibb co . ( bmy ): forxiga approval should be boon for ... URL""

Hmm, let me break this down. The main part seems to be mentioning Markups Reactitive and bringing up some other companies like Myer's Squibb co. It ends with a quote about ""forxiga approval should be boon for..."" and then a link.

First step is to figure out the target stock. The symbol is mrk, so I'm guessing it's about that company or perhaps in the same industry since they're part of the same group. Maybe it's related to healthcare products or something like that.

Now, analyzing each tweet factor. The user is pointing out issues with BMY and suggesting that their approval should be positive. So there's a negative point here because BMY isn't doing well. But then there's an opinion about forxiga, which I'm not sure what that stock stands for. Maybe it's another company in the same sector.

Next, assessing sentiment. The tweet is more of a commentary rather than a formal statement. It seems like the author is suggesting a positive outlook on BMY and possibly another company. They might be trying to encourage investors to vote their company positively or recommend others as well.

Considering market dynamics, negative news about BMY could lead some investors to avoid or sell their shares, which would lower the stock price if it's a short-term effect. But without knowing more about the broader market or current sentiment, it's hard to say for sure. If they're pointing out that approval should be positive, maybe there's an intention to boost investor confidence.

Overall, the tweet is expressing concern and offering advice but isn't providing strong information to make a decision immediately. It might not have enough weight to tip the balance yet. So I'm leaning towards it being [Neutral] because while there's some negative feedback, the suggestion could be seen as cautious rather than definitive."
2014-01-10,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze the given tweet about a company and determine its impact on their stock price. The tweet is: ""$ mrk alnylam provides key 2014 goals for rnai therapeutics pipeline URL"". 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweet. The part that looks like the stock symbol might be ""mrk"" or ""rnai"", but looking closer, it says ""mrk alnylam provides key 2014 goals for rnai therapeutics pipeline URL"". Hmm, maybe the stock symbol is ""rnai"". That's what I'm more familiar with; rnaí is a stock code.

Now, I have to analyze each tweet. In this case, there's only one tweet provided. So the factors are straightforward: positive and negative aspects from this tweet.

Looking at the tweet, it says ""mrk alnylam provides key 2014 goals for rnai therapeutics pipeline URL."" The main points here are that mrk alnylam is offering significant 2014 goals related to their pipeline. That suggests they're looking ahead and have a plan.

Positive factors: The tweet shows confidence or positive outlook on the company's future, specifically mentioning 2014 goals which implies strategic planning for the next year.

Negative factors: There doesn't seem to be any negative information here; it only mentions providing key 2014 goals. So no negative aspects mentioned.

Putting this together: Positive factors indicate optimism about the stock, and there's no negative context provided. This would generally lead investors to see a positive outlook for the stock price in the coming months or years.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is likely positive."
2014-01-11,Missing,File not found
2014-01-12,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets for JPM (JPM). 

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying. The first tweet says, ""maybe . maybe not . issue w / other bacei has been ph1 / 2 safety . expect more on mk - 8931 @ jpm 14 now that $ mrk is in ph3 ."" So it seems like JPM is mentioned with some specific technical terms. PH stands for ""Price Target"" which might mean they're aiming for a certain price level. The mention of safety and expecting more information suggests uncertainty or potential risks, which could indicate a negative outlook.

The second tweet is a direct quote from a Twitter user: ""@jpm #investing"". While I don't have context on what the user is saying here, it might be related to investing in JPM. If they're pushing investment-related content, that could imply confidence or a positive sentiment towards the stock.

Putting these together, the first tweet raises questions about the company's safety and future price target, which are concerns. The second tweet seems more about opinions on investing. So overall, there's some uncertainty from the first tweet but mostly positive from the second. I'm leaning towards [Positive] because while there's some hesitation, the general sentiment seems to be hopeful or cautious."
2014-01-13,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock prices. I've been given four tweets and need to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of affecting a company's stock price.

First, I'll look at each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says ""rt AT_USER $ alny acquires merck / sirna rnai assets for $ 25m cash + $ 150m stock + $ 115m milestone URL $ mrk bot sirn …"" So, it seems like the company is acquiring another entity. They're spending money and maybe getting more milestones ahead. Acquiring another company can sometimes be seen as a positive because it shows expansion or diversification. But I'm not sure if that's enough to call it positive just yet.

2. The second tweet is "" $ mrk - merck rises most since 2009 on seeking early fda approval -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" This looks like the company's shares are rising significantly after a major regulatory move, specifically FDA approval. FDA approvals can be positive because they usually indicate progress in bringing medical devices to patients, which is a good sign for growth. This seems like a strong indicator of positive sentiment.

3. The third tweet corrects metrics: ""better metric finds value URL $ goog google $ csco $ msft $ intc $ orcl $ fb $ xom $ cvx $ sny $ mrk."" Here, the company is correcting their metrics to find value. Finding valuable data can be beneficial because it can help the stock price go up. So this is definitely a positive sign.

4. The fourth tweet mentions ""lgnd getting a lit ' pop to new 4 + yr high w / squeezy 13 + dtc .. expecting to hear from partner $ mrk re :p h3 mk - 8931 ( bace for alz ) @ jpm 14 ."". It sounds like the company is reaching a peak, especially with ""squeezy,"" which usually means significant expansion. This could be an indication that things are heating up in the market, possibly leading to higher stock prices.

Now, I'll try to assess each tweet's impact:

- Tweet 1 seems positive because acquiring more assets and milestones could indicate growth.
- Tweet 2 is a clear rise since 2009 with FDA approval, which is positive.
- Tweet 3 shows they're finding good metrics, so it's positive.
- Tweet 4 talks about reaching a peak with expansion, which also sounds positive.

Putting it all together, the overall sentiment should be positive because each tweet presents positive developments: acquisition, rising stock due to regulatory changes, finding valuable data, and significant market expansion. So, I'll conclude it as [Positive]."
2014-01-14,Neutral,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for mkm partners. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at tweet 1: ""mkm partners reiterated $ mrk at buy with pt : $64 ( +22 % from here ) ( b)"". Hmm, that mentions MRK and mentions the percentage change (+22%) but doesn't specify a symbol or mention any specific company. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's referring to the stock price? Or is there another way to extract the symbol?

Wait, tweet 1 seems to be about mkm partners buying MRK (which could stand for Merck) and mentions a +22% gain. But how does that translate to a specific stock symbol? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's implied that they're referring to their stock symbols, but without knowing the symbol, it's hard to assess.

For tweet 2: ""get more info on $ anat $ fcs $ axl $ mrk visit URL"". It mentions four different stocks (Natas, FCS, AXL, MRK) and a visit URL. Not sure how this affects the stock price; maybe it's just information retrieval, so not directly impacting.

 Tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER $ bmy by not talking about $ mrk specifically , $ bmy talks about $ mrk . jpm 14"". Here, ""bmy"" might be another stock. The user is telling someone else that BMY isn't focusing on MRK specifically and mentions MRK instead. This could influence investor sentiment if other stocks are perceived as irrelevant or if BMY's approach affects the market.

Tweet 4: ""AT_USER see msd ( merck ) spokesperson lie about patient safety information to the media URL $ mrk msd"". It refers to a spokesperson from Merck (MSD) lying about patient safety info. This could raise concerns about the credibility of MSD, which might affect investor perceptions of Merck's stock performance.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is positive because they're buying MRK and showing a gain. Tweet 4 is negative because the spokesperson lies about safety info. Tweets 2 and 3 don't directly mention stock symbols or impact on the company's performance, so their sentiment might be neutral.

So overall, there are both positive and negative signals. Positive tweets like tweet 1 could boost investor confidence if others follow suit. Negative tweets like tweet 4 could lower expectations. But without knowing how much weight each tweet has, it's hard to say the overall impact on mkm partners' stock price."
2014-01-15,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of [mrk]. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ mrk's bloomfield at fda crdac : vorapaxar should be prescribed to appropriate post-mi patients at risk for 2ndary athe …"" It seems like the user is talking about a medication called VORAPAXAR and mentioning something related to medical devices. However, without specific information on how this affects [mrk], it's hard to assess the sentiment.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER viewpoints : with something to prove , merck & co . comes out fighting in cancer immunotherapy race URL $ mrk"" Here, the user is talking about a merger between Merck and Co. and seems interested in Cancer Immunotherapy. While this might affect [mrk] as it's a competitor in similar fields, the sentiment isn't clear enough to determine overall positive or negative.

Third tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER lousy data . $ mrk pi + ns5a combo better , no interest . $ vrtx shudve given up on hcv for cf focus once fda scrutiny came"" This one is critical. The user clearly has a lot of frustration about poor data and mentions ""no interest."" The mention of HCV, which could be related to their previous discussions, adds more context but doesn't directly link to [mrk]. The lack of positive attention here suggests a negative sentiment.

Fourth tweet: ""$ mrk 3 of the safest dividend stocks for retirees URL"" This tweet is encouraging investors about [mrk] as a safe option for retirees. It highlights their safety record in providing dividends, which can positively influence investor sentiment.

Putting it all together, while some tweets show frustration or positive mentions like the last one, the third one has strong negative language and no clear link to [mrk]. Therefore, overall sentiment seems negative."
2014-01-16,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided two tweets and wants an analysis of their impact on the stock price of a company. They've specified that the response should be in one of three categories: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet, ""mrk merck & co , inc . : big pharma checkup for 2014 URL"", it seems like ""mrk"" is the stock symbol. So, we're looking at Merck.

The second tweet is ""$ mrk : merck provides statement on fda advisory committee for vorapaxar"". Here, it also mentions ""mrk"", so again, Merck.

Now, I'll analyze each tweet separately to identify Positive and Negative factors and assess the sentiment towards investor sentiment.

For the first tweet: ""big pharma checkup for 2014 URL"". The phrase ""checkup"" indicates a positive action, suggesting they're getting closer to completing their pharma product. This could be seen as good news because it moves them closer to profitability or regulatory approval.

The second tweet mentions that Merck provides a statement on the FDA advisory committee for Vorapaxar. A statement from a FDA advisory is usually a positive sign as it's a regulatory update, which can positively impact the stock price by signaling confidence in their drug development.

Putting both tweets together, they both provide positive information about Merck's progress and regulatory developments. These factors are favorable to investors, especially if they're looking at how these developments align with the company's goals or future plans.

Therefore, considering the two tweets contribute positively, I'll conclude that the overall sentiment is Positive."

2014-01-21,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem step by step. So, I have two tweets here and I need to determine their impact on a company's stock price based on these tweets. The output should be either ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

First, the task mentions identifying the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER bullish set-ups for tuesday URL $ atml $ bbry $ ctic $ mrk $ ontx $ rvm $ stml $ stxs"". Hmm, this one seems a bit confusing because it's listing several stocks and mentions a ""tuesday URL,"" which doesn't make much sense in the context of stock symbols. Maybe there's a typo or something missing here.

Moving to the second tweet: ""find the next hot pennystock $ manh $ ati $ chl $ mrk check out URL"". Again, similar structure as the first tweet. It mentions different stocks like pennystock and other abbreviations. The word ""check out"" is also there, which again doesn't fit into stock symbols.

Wait a minute, maybe both tweets are related to the same company? Or perhaps each tweet is about multiple companies or sectors? I need to figure out what's common across these tweets.

Looking at the first tweet: It seems like AT_USER is being mentioned with positive words like ""bullish"" and ""set-ups."" So maybe this is an account or a user expressing bullish sentiment towards certain stocks, possibly related to a particular sector. The other stocks listed could be in a specific category, perhaps tech-related given the abbreviations like atml, bbry.

In the second tweet: ""find the next hot pennystock"" suggests that pennystock is a target stock, maybe in the technology or fintech space. The presence of ""check out URL"" makes me think it's related to a search for a new URL or platform, possibly an investment opportunity.

So both tweets are talking about upcoming stocks, specifically pennystock and other tech/finTech companies. But without more context on what AT_USER stands for or which sector these stocks belong to, it's hard to say the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

Wait, maybe ""bullish"" in the first tweet implies that the user expects strong growth or favorable news about these stocks. That could lead to a positive impact if the market reacts favorably.

The second tweet mentions searching for a ""hot"" pennystock and checking out URLs, which might suggest that investors are actively looking for potential new tech platforms, indicating optimism about their potential success.

Putting it all together, both tweets seem to indicate optimism or anticipation in the tech/finTech space. They're encouraging investors to stay informed about upcoming trends or products, possibly expecting positive developments from the listed companies.

Therefore, combining these thoughts, the overall sentiment seems positive because the information is expected to lead to favorable reactions in the stock market."
2014-01-22,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price impact. Let me start by looking at each tweet separately.

First tweet: ""couple of stocks to watch $ hrg $ idsa $ airm $ mrk check out URL"". This seems like an instruction or maybe something from a colleague suggesting investments. It doesn't seem positive or negative, more like advice rather than financial analysis. So I'll note it as [Neutral].

Second tweet: ""couple of stocks to watch $ hrg $ idsa $ airm $ mrk check out URL"". Similar structure here, another set of instructions. Again, not giving any information on the stock's performance. Still [Neutral].

Wait, am I missing something? Let me double-check. Both tweets are repeating the same thing: suggesting stocks to watch or check out. That doesn't seem like it affects their financial value. They're just giving directions or materials. So definitely no positive or negative intent here.

I think that's all. No other factors or emotions expressed in these tweets, so overall sentiment remains neutral."

2014-01-27,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock of Markemark (MRK). First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet.

Looking at the first tweet: ""nice move underway on the $ mrk u / g to overweight by $ ms . merck"". Hmm, that doesn't seem to specify a stock. It could be any stock since it's all about MRK and other companies mentioned are also referred to as ""mrk"". So maybe this is too vague.

The second tweet: ""$ mrk rises 2.56 % , currently trading at $ 53.31"". Here, clearly the target stock is Markemark (MRK). I can note that.

Third tweet: ""monday analyst moves : cisco systems , inc . , merck & co . , inc . , xerox ... $ mrk URL"". This seems similar to the first one but includes COIN and XEROX as well. It's a bit confusing, but again, it refers to MRK.

Fourth tweet: ""bayp insider disclosure $ bayp $ jks $ mrk $ tsl $ qcom buy or sell ? , chart , open , recent news , is this one to watch ? s URL"". The target stock here is also clearly MRK. It mentions an insider deal and offers to buy/sell, but it doesn't specify the price range.

So I have three mentions of MRK: two from the second tweet and one more in the third and fourth tweets. Let me focus on these three since they mention the same stock symbol as per the instructions.

Looking at each relevant tweet for positive or negative factors:

1. ""nice move underway on the $ mrk u / g to overweight by $ ms . merck"". The language is positive, suggesting Markemark is doing well. It says MRK is overweighting their portfolio, which might indicate success and potential gains.

2. ""$ mrk rises 2.56 % , currently trading at $ 53.31"". This is straightforward—MRK has risen by a certain percentage. Positive action from the company itself.

3. ""morning analyst moves : cisco systems , inc . , merck & co . , inc . , xerox ... $ mrk URL"". The mention of COIN and XEROX, but again, MRK is clearly referred to here. It doesn't provide any information about market performance yet, just mentions actions from analysts.

Now for sentiment analysis:

The second tweet is directly positive with a 2.56% rise, which adds significant gains. The third tweet includes other companies and focuses on the company's stock but without specific news or predictions. However, it could imply that there might be some investment interest or analysis.

Putting it together: Two tweets mention MRK positively—two in strength and one in activity—and a third is neutral about its performance. So overall, it looks like Markemark is performing well with some positive mentions from other sectors but no specific positive indicators on the stock's current status.

So combining these factors, I think there's enough positive information suggesting that MRK might be doing well, so the sentiment is likely Positive."

2014-01-30,Positive,"Alright, let me break down how I approached this problem step by step.

First, I need to identify the stock symbol from the provided tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER $ bmy $ mrk $ rog gs : estimated timeline for pd - 1 trials and launches URL."" It seems that AT_USER is the stock symbol here, specifically shorting BMY, MRK, ROG, and GS.

Next, I have to analyze each relevant tweet. The only relevant part of this tweet seems to be ""estimated timeline for pd - 1 trials and launches URL."" There's no other tweet provided, so I can't analyze it further. 

Since there are no additional tweets to consider, my analysis is limited. However, I need to make a conclusion based on the information available.

Looking at the factors: ""estimated timeline for pd - 1 trials and launches URL"" seems positive because it's about timelines and potential upcoming projects, which can influence investor sentiment positively. The use of ""pd - 1 trials"" might indicate optimism towards future investments or developments in their stock.

Since there are no negative factors mentioned and the information is optimistic, I think the overall impact is positive. So, the stock may be doing well, but it's not certain without more context."

2014-02-01,Positive,"Okay, so I'm looking at these tweets about potential treatments for kidney cancer using blocking agents. The user mentioned something called ""pd - 1 - & pdL-1 – blocking agents."" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down.

First, PD and PD L-1 rings a bell in the medical field. PD stands for proton pump inhibitor, which are drugs like furosemide used to treat kidney issues because they help increase fluid outflow from the kidneys. PD L-1 seems odd but might be another compound, possibly another type of drug or a variant that interacts with the first.

The tweets talk about these agents potentially treating kidney cancer. I'm not entirely sure what the drugs themselves are, but I think focusing on their potential uses would help. Proton pump inhibitors can sometimes reduce blood pressure and may also have antiviral effects, which could be useful in treating various infections, including those from kidney diseases.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions ""dr . david f . mcdermott discusses the potential of pd - 1 - & pdL-1 – blocking agents to treat kidney cancer gu14 $ bmy $ mrk URL."" This seems like a positive note because it's talking about something that could be beneficial for treating cancer. The mention of treating cancer suggests a possible drug's advantage, which is generally seen as positive by investors.

2. The second tweet doesn't provide any information, so I can't do much with it. It just says ""tweet-by-tweet analysis"" and ""overall sentiment summary.""

3. The third tweet mentions the same drugs again: ""rt AT_USER dr . david f . mcdermott discusses the potential of pd - 1 - & pdL-1 – blocking agents to treat kidney cancer gu14 $ bmy $ mrk URL."" This seems repetitive, but I can see it reinforcing the idea that these agents are being discussed for their potential benefits.

Considering all three tweets, they're all emphasizing the potential benefits and uses of proton pump inhibitors in treating kidney diseases. Since PD and PD L-1 are both drugs used for their antihypertonic effects and might have immunomodulatory properties, their use in cancer treatment could be a significant benefit. Investors often look at clinical trials and potential uses to assess stock performance.

But wait, I'm not sure if these blocking agents specifically target kidney cancer or just other diseases. If they're used for something else, the impact could vary. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively. From what's available, they seem promising as a topic in investment because of their potential therapeutic benefits.

So putting it all together, all three tweets are highlighting the positive aspects of PD and PD L-1 being discussed for potential treatments. This suggests that the company is likely to perform well as investors look ahead to clinical trials and other developments in these drugs."
2014-02-02,Neutral,"Alright, let me break down how I would analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for the given company.

First, looking at the target stock symbol mentioned in both tweets: FRX. That tells me we're focusing on this specific stock. 

Now, examining the first tweet, it mentions ranking positions and some stocks. It doesn't provide any positive or negative information about FRX itself. So, no direct info here—probably neutral because nothing stands out as a trend.

The second tweet is more involved. It talks about ""rt AT_USER dr . david f . mcdermott discusses the potential of pd - 1 - & pdl - 1 – blocking agents to treat kidney cancer gu14 $ bmy $ mrk URL"". Hmm, this seems like something related to healthcare technology. BMY is a biotech company, and MRK is also biotech. The mention of kidney cancer treatment suggests they might be investing in medical devices or treatments.

Looking at the keywords: blocking agents for kidney cancer. I'm not sure about the specifics, but if these companies are being discussed in this context, it could mean they're looking to enter a specific market or invest in a new technology related to healthcare. But how does that affect FRX? It doesn't specify whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

Considering the overall sentiment, without specific information on FRX's performance, trends, or any news about the stock, it's hard to assess. Both tweets are speculative and discussing potential investments in other companies rather than the target stock itself.

So, combining both tweets, I don't see any positive, negative, or neutral messages that would directly influence FRX. They're more about discussing a topic that doesn't relate to FRX's performance.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is neutral because there are no clear trends or reasons to believe FRX's price will go up or down."
2014-02-03,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Merck. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the target stock is Merck, which stands for MRK. The first tweet mentions a cancer deal with a Belgian biotech company that could rise to €1.7 billion. The second tweet talks about AT_USER and ABLYF, which I think are likely typo errors or misspellings of ""Ablyf"" or another entity related to Merck or their deal.

Looking at the first tweet, it's stating an expected revenue increase from a cancer-related biotech company. Cancer deals can be significant because they're often for drug development, which is a major investment for pharma companies. This could boost Merck's stock as they might see increased demand or higher revenue in that sector. The mention of €1.7 billion is substantial and positive.

The second tweet seems to discuss a potential deal worth $2.3 billion but with unclear details. It mentions ""ABLYF,"" which I'm not entirely sure about, but it's likely another cancer-related company or part of their product development for cancer treatments. If this deal is significant and aligns with Merck's current strategies in pharma, especially regarding cancer cures, it could positively impact the stock price as well.

Both tweets are talking about future revenue increases from cancer-related companies. Revenue growth in pharmaceuticals can be a good indicator of a company's future performance because it shows confidence in their product development efforts and expanded market reach. Investors often look at how big and significant these deals might become, especially if they're in sectors like cancer treatment which is growing rapidly.

I also need to consider other factors: if the tweets are related to strategic partnerships or collaborations with biotech companies that could lead to joint ventures or shared resources, this can enhance Merck's product portfolio and market presence. Additionally, a steady increase in revenue from such deals can contribute positively to the stock price because it reflects optimism about future earnings and expanded business opportunities.

I should also think about the tone of these tweets. They are quite positive, discussing potential deals with cancer companies, which is a current trend for pharma. This suggests that investors might see these as attractive investments, leading them to buy more shares in Merck. The mention of 'cancer' indicates they're focused on a specific and growing industry segment, which can drive up stock price unless the company shows negative developments.

Putting it all together, both tweets are highlighting expected positive impacts from future deals in cancer-related sectors, which align with Merck's current strategies. These could translate into increased revenue streams and market exposure, contributing to a more positive overall sentiment for the stock."
2014-02-04,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants me to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a given company using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to understand what information is in each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""icymi : nih , 10 drug makers in $230m + pact to attack Alzheimer's , other diseases URL sny $ gsk $ jnj $ lly $ pfe $ mrk"". It seems like this tweet mentions several things: a company (maybe ""icymi"") with $230 million revenue, a partnership to attack Alzheimer's disease, and some URLs pointing to different companies. The sentiment here is positive because it talks about expansion into new markets and partnerships.

For each tweet, I should separate the factors into positive and negative. Then assess how each factor might influence investor sentiment. Since this is just one tweet, the overall sentiment could be a mix of positive and negative. However, focusing on the most prominent points like new partnerships and high revenue potential seems to lean towards a positive impact.

I think the key factors here are the partnership to attack Alzheimer's and their proposed $230 million revenue. These seem like strong indicators of growth and potential profitability. So, even though there's some mention of other diseases, it doesn't outweigh the positive aspects mentioned. 

Therefore, combining these elements suggests a favorable outlook for the stock price."
2014-02-05,Positive,"Okay, so I have to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Mrk. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually and then see how they all fit together.

First, there's an insider trading news about $acco and others on Mrk. That might be positive because insider info can sometimes indicate good management or potential risks, but I'm not sure if it's positive for the stock itself.

Next, earnings reports are mentioned: notable earnings 2/4 /14 before the open, and some other companies in between. Earnings reports can affect investors' sentiment. If it's a positive report, that might be good news, but if there were issues like delays or problems, it could be negative. I don't have specific info on whether these earnings were good or bad, so this is uncertain.

Then there are mentions of stock prices dropping and上涨 across various companies including $mrk. If Mrk's price is dropping while others are rising, that might indicate a shift in market sentiment or something else affecting the company, which could influence investor sentiment towards it.

The next tweet is about $mrk receiving a new alert for an EPS trough year. An eps (Earnings Per Share) being at its lowest can be seen as good news because it shows consistency, but sometimes events like earnings dips might also indicate underlying issues or strategic moves that could be bad for the stock if they're exploited by investors.

There's a mention of $mrk's PD-1 deals with Pfeffer. PD stands for Partner Distribution. If Mrk is involved in collaborations to distribute their products, that could affect demand and possibly price movements. But unless there are specific reasons related to their product, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative.

Lastly, a mention of Novartis having a vaccine with suitors flirting might indicate potential conflicts or partnerships. If they're involved, it could lead to changes in market dynamics, which might influence stock prices.

Putting all these together: insider info can be positive, earnings reports are mixed (could be good or bad), some stocks dropping and others rising affect sentiment, EPS at trough is usually positive but depends on context, PD-1 deals might have side effects, and the vaccine mention could cause changes in dynamics. Overall, it seems like there's a mix of factors that might not give a clear overall trend. Maybe Mrk is performing well enough that it's considered positive."
2014-02-06,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of pennystock.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""pennystock research on $ qcom $ educ $ endp $ mrk i suggest URL."" The stock symbol here is likely QCOM. Then the second tweet mentions MRK and a video about the markets being mixed and waiting for the january jobs report, which would be StockAction.

Next, I'll break down each tweet into factors: Positive and Negative. For the first tweet, it's talking about researching QCOM, suggesting a URL, so both are positive. The second tweet is discussing the market situation and stock action, but it seems neutral because it's more about the current events rather than strong information.

Now, evaluating the sentiment for each tweet. The first one is promoting QCOM with a suggestion to go somewhere else, which should be positive. The second tweet is providing context without specific praise or criticism, so it's neutral.

Putting it all together, since there are both positive and neutral factors, I need to decide if they combine positively or not. While the first tweet has a positive impact, the second doesn't add much in terms of opinion. Therefore, the overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning slightly positive."
2014-02-07,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. Let me start by analyzing each tweet separately.

First tweet: ""$ mrk merck & co . , inc . pushing the throttle on oncology URL."" This seems like a technical message from a company announcing a decision about their oncology product, specifically mentioning that they're stopping some operations. Companies often release such news to prevent negative press or reflect internal decisions. I'm not sure if this will directly impact stock price unless it affects their performance or earnings.

Second tweet: ""$ shoud you sell $ zhne $ liox $ il $ mrk worth a look URL."" This is in Chinese, which makes it harder for me to understand. Translating it might give more context. It seems like the user is suggesting selling shares of three different companies (zhne, liox, il) because they think the stock of mrk is worth looking at. If the tweet is about suggesting sell orders, that's a negative action for investors because it reduces their net position in mrk.

I don't have access to real-time financial data or market trends, but based on this information, the first tweet might indicate strategic decisions from the company and could affect their future performance metrics, which are indicators of stock price. The second tweet suggests selling shares, which is a significant negative move as it directly impacts the investor's net position.

Since both tweets can have mixed effects, I'm considering that they might be providing information about the company's strategy but also suggesting a specific action. Without more context on how these actions correlate with future performance, it's hard to assign a definitive sentiment. However, since one is negative and the other could either be positive or neutral depending on the situation, I need to make an educated guess.

Given that the second tweet directly mentions selling shares, which can lead to market sell pressure, this might have a negative impact on the stock price. The first tweet could provide insights into their operations, but without knowing the context of mrk's financial performance or other related factors, it's speculative."
2014-02-08,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral regarding a given stock, like Expedia. The user provided two tweets: 

1. $ mrk expedia surge caps week of mixed s & p 500 earnings reports URL

2. $ mrk expedia surge caps week of mixed s & p 500 earnings reports url

I need to determine their impact on the stock price, but since I don't know which specific stock they're referring to (like Expedia), maybe it's a typo or repetition? Maybe both tweets are about Expedia. 

First, the user wants me to analyze each tweet for positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards the company. Let's break down each tweet.

Looking at the first tweet: ""expedia surge caps week of mixed s & p 500 earnings reports URL"". It mentions the S&P 500 earnings report and includes a URL. I'm not sure if 'surge caps' is a real term, but it seems related to financials. The mention of the earnings report makes me think that this tweet could be signaling about the company's performance.

The second tweet looks identical except for a capitalization letter: ""$ mrk expedia surge caps week of mixed s & p 500 earnings reports url"". It's just $MRK, which is the ticker symbol for Expedia. So both tweets are likely referring to Expedia.

Now, considering that these tweets are about financials and earnings, they might indicate how well the company is performing. Positive factors would mean a good outlook, negative factors could lead to stock cut-offs or dips. 

But since neither tweet provides any specific information beyond the earnings report and mention of the S&P 500, it's hard to tell if these are positive or negative. They might be neutral if there's no clear indication that the company is improving or declining.

Wait, maybe the 'surge caps' is a typo for something else? Or could it mean something else entirely? It's also possible that the tweet is more about the stock market in general rather than specific to Expedia. 

Since both tweets are about the same thing and don't mention any positive or negative indicators related to the company's financials, it might be considered neutral. There's no clear indication of improved performance or a decline.

So, after considering all factors, I think each tweet is [Neutral]."
2014-02-09,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock price. The user provided two tweets and asked for an assessment into whether they'll positively, neutrally, or negatively affect a company's future stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk german Drugmaker merck steps up push into biosimilars URL"". The company here is Merck (MRK), and they're pushing into biosimilars. That's a specific area in drug development.

Now, I should break down each tweet. In the first one, it mentions that Merck is increasing their investment in biosimilars. That sounds like they are expanding into another market or looking to enter a new area. This could potentially give them more market reach and expand their revenue streams.

Looking at the second tweet: ""$ mrk german Drugmaker merck steps up push into biosimilars URL"". Wait, that seems identical to the first one. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps they're repurposing this tweet for something else. I'll assume they're repeating the same information to avoid duplication.

So, both tweets are about Merck pushing into biosimilars, which is an expansion in their drug development strategies. This usually implies that their stock could see some positive news because they're making bigger moves and possibly increasing their product offerings.

I should consider the potential impact on their revenue, earnings, or market position. If Merck invests more in biosimilars, it might lead to higher demand for similar drugs, which could boost their sales. This would likely result in positive sentiment as investors might feel more confident about future performance.

But wait, I shouldn't just assume everything is positive. Sometimes, increased focus on a specific product can lead to short-term gains, but long-term impacts depend on broader market conditions and the company's ability to sustain growth without external factors like economic downturns or competition issues.

In this case, though, since it's a strategic move into biosimilars, which is part of their drug development strategy, it could be viewed as a positive sign. The stock might experience a boost in price if they can demonstrate the success of these investments within the existing portfolio or expand their product lines.

Therefore, considering all this, I'll assess that the overall sentiment is likely [Positive]."

2014-02-11,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided two tweets related to an S&P 500 index stock and is asking for the likely impact on its future stock price. They want me to determine if it will be positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Both tweets mention ""mrk,"" which stands for Microsoft, Inc., so that's our target stock: Microsoft (MSFT).

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says, ""$ mrk merck aims to be first to the finish line with generic of $ sny's lantus URL via AT_USER."" Hmm, ""first to the finish line"" sounds like a goal or an aim. The mention of $ sny's URL suggests they're providing information about Microsoft's stock, possibly related to earnings or financial updates. This could be a positive factor because it might show confidence in their stock performance.

The second tweet is ""$ mrk - statement of changes in beneficial ownership ( 4 ) URL."" ""Beneficial ownership"" indicates that the company is changing who owns what. This can signal growth as employees or directors are joining, which is often seen as good news for investor sentiment and stock value.

Looking at both tweets together, they provide positive information about Microsoft's operations and management changes. They don't mention any negative developments but rather future goals and company internal changes. So the overall impact seems to be positive because the relevant factors are positive indicators of the stock's potential improvement."
2014-02-12,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze a tweet about an insider selling Merck stock and determine its impact on the company's future stock price. They've provided specific instructions on how to do it.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweet. It mentions ""mrk,"" which is the ticker symbol for Merck in the market capitalization tracker, so that should be our focus.

Next, I have to break down each tweet into Positive and Negative factors. The given tweet is just one, so that's straightforward: it's a positive factor because of the insider selling activity. However, since this is the only tweet provided, I don't need to consider other ones for now.

Then, assessing sentiment isn't possible with just one tweet; it would require analyzing multiple sources or context. But the user has specified that I must conclude with a single line indicating [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since we can only analyze this tweet, I have to make an educated guess based on insider selling typically being seen as speculative and potentially short-term.

Given that, I'll lean towards a Positive sentiment for now because it's more of a market update rather than negative news. However, the user emphasized using one line, so I must stick to that structure despite the limitations."

2014-02-15,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on Merck's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol 'mrk', that's Merck, right? So we need to focus on their performance based on these tweets.

Looking at tweet 1: ""merck's decision to sell consumer division is timely and will lead to a higher stock price URL mrk"". Hmm, this tweet says they're selling the consumer division. If they're selling off parts of their business, especially if it's in a critical area like healthcare or pharmaceuticals, that could hurt their revenue growth. So by announcing they'll sell the consumer division, they might reduce their overall performance.

Now, tweet 2: ""inside selling : clark golestani sells 5,990 shares of merck & co stock $ mrk URL"". This one specifically mentions insider selling, which is a red flag. If an internal person is selling shares, it can lead to more investor sentiment shifting. Insider trading or selling typically increases risk because it's seen as manipulation or anti-competitive behavior.

Putting these together: The first tweet suggests they're reducing the consumer division, affecting their main business areas. The second one indicates insider selling, which can be seen as negative news if investors are more skeptical about Merck.

So overall, both tweets point to reduced profitability and increased risk. This should lead to a negative impact on the stock price."
2014-02-16,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze tweets about a stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative on it for the future price impact.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the provided tweets. Looking at the first tweet, it says ""rt AT_USER merck : 7 different insiders have sold shares this month URL $ mrk"". So, the stock symbol here is MKR (Merck), as it's followed by a dollar sign.

Next, I'll go through each relevant tweet one by one. The second tweet mentions insider trading news on MRK, CPAN, and IBM FINANCIAL. That seems relevant because these are related to Merck. It also says ""7 different insiders have sold shares this month"". This is key information—so the sentiment here is clear that someone is selling shares.

Now, putting it together, each tweet contributes to the overall sentiment. The insider trading news directly affects investor sentiment by pushing them to sell their shares. Since there are multiple transactions and the word ""sold"" is mentioned, it's a strong indicator of potential negative impact on the stock price.

I should also consider any other relevant tweets I might have missed. In this case, only two tweets are provided. Both focus heavily on insider trading actions, which are typically bad news for investors because they can increase the likelihood that the stock will drop in value as people sell their shares out of fear of losses.

So, considering all factors—both positive (7 insiders sold shares) and negative (insider trading news), the overall sentiment is likely to be Negative. It's a clear signal that the stock might decline."

2014-02-18,Negative,"Alright, so I've got these three tweets about various stocks. My task is to determine whether each tweet has a positive, neutral, or negative impact on their stock prices. Let me go through each one step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER fda launches secure supply chain pilot ; prequalified $ abbv $ agn astellas $ bms $ celg ge health $ gsk $ mrk myl $ nvs $ pfe $…"" Hmm, I notice that there are mentions of FDA approvals and various companies like Abbv, Agn, Astellas, etc. I don't know if these companies are positively or negatively impacting the stock directly. But the fact that they're from pharmaceutical companies might be a positive sign for those sectors. However, without specific details on how these stocks perform, it's hard to say. Maybe it's just general information.

The second tweet says: ""pennystock research on $ mrk $ qcom $ mtd $ grpn investing URL."" This seems like news about research into $ MRK stock, which is a biologics company. If there's investment interest or news related to that stock, it could influence its price. I'm not sure if the context is positive or negative here.

The third tweet: ""13f filed by ruane , cunniff & goldfarb inc URL new buys : $ prgo $ inwk $ vz $ mrk sells : $ upl $ chsp $ vz $ wbco."" This one mentions a 13F filing, which is a financial regulatory report. It talks about the company buying some stocks and selling others. If there's actual trading happening, that could affect stock prices. But without knowing if it's a positive or negative action, it's tricky.

Putting it all together: I don't have enough context to assess each tweet individually. Some are about broader sectors, while others are about specific companies with trades. Without more details on how these stocks perform or the nature of their recent activities, I can't confidently assign a sentiment to each one."
2014-02-19,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the provided tweets affect the stock price of Merck & Co. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. The only stock symbol mentioned is ""mrk,"" which stands for Merck & Co., a well-known pharmaceutical company. So, we're focusing on that particular stock here.

Next, each tweet has two parts: Positive and Negative factors. For each relevant tweet, I should separate these factors. Let's look at the first tweet: ""$ mrk thestreet reiterates "" buy "" rating for merck & co ( mrk ) URL.""

So, this tweet is about providing a buy rating to Merck & Co. It also includes a URL link which might be additional information or a call to action. But the main focus here is the sentiment it conveys.

Now, breaking down that tweet: ""buy"" rating is positive, and they're inviting them to visit their website with a URL. Since ""buy"" is neutral in sentiment terms but adds value by linking to more information or resources, this suggests positive sentiment towards increasing investor interest or exposure.

There are no other relevant tweets provided, so I'm focusing solely on this one. Combining the factors: Positive (buy) and Neutral (linking to info), overall the sentiment seems positive because they're offering a way for investors to engage with Merck & Co.

Therefore, considering all factors, especially the link which indicates an opportunity or engagement, the impact is likely positive."
2014-02-20,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. So, I have to look at each tweet individually and then combine them to see if it's positive, neutral, or negative overall.

First tweet: ""mrk - 9:49 am merck displays relative strength , edges just above last weeks ... -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". Hmm, this seems like a news article linked. It mentions ""relative strength"" and looks at the price compared to last week. I know that relative strength can indicate if a stock is gaining or losing ground in comparison to others, which usually gives positive sentiment.

Second tweet: Just now, mrk shares update, with some stock action. This is more of an update from another user's perspective, suggesting they found something valuable about the stock. That often leads to positive reactions because it can boost confidence and increase demand for the stock.

Putting these together, both tweets are related to Mrk stock. The first one points out that the stock has relative strength, which is a positive indicator. The second tweet provides more context or an update, which also adds to investor interest. So combining them, the overall sentiment should be positive because all signs point towards the stock performing well."
2014-02-21,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The task is similar to what I did before, but this time, looking at two specific tweets.

First, let me identify the target stock from each tweet. In the first tweet, it says ""don't underestimate amgen"" and mentions several URLs including $azn$, $lly$, and $mrk$. So, Amgen is clearly the company here. 

Now, I need to analyze each tweet separately for positive or negative factors. The second tweet is about Jim, with some volume details on February 20th, 2014. That seems a bit more specific—maybe related to another company?

Wait, for the first tweet: ""don't underestimate amgen : part 2b URL $ azn $ lly $ mrk $ amgn"". So the mention of multiple URLs probably indicates that Amgen's stock is priced at those certain dollars. Maybe $azn$ is Amazon, $lly$ is left-handed lamping? Hmm, I'm not sure about these abbreviations. It could be a typo or something else.

But focusing on what I know: ""amgen"" is likely the company, and the rest might just be URLs for stock prices or other info. The sentiment here seems positive because it's encouraging people to not underestimate Amgen, which generally boosts confidence and can influence investor behavior.

The second tweet: ""jim 50 : $ mrk volume datefeb 20 2014 open 55.11 high 56 lo URL"". Jim is a stock symbol, MRK is another company. The mention of ""volume"" on Feb 20, 2014—could be some earnings or news related to that date. Since it's about volume and maybe trading activity, it could indicate investor sentiment. But without specific information, it's hard to tell if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Maybe a minor trade day?

Putting it together: The first tweet is clearly positive because of the encouragement towards Amgen, which might lead people to buy more shares. The second tweet is about MRK with volume data—could be neutral since it doesn't provide a clear sentiment on its own.

Now, overall sentiment is probably leaning positive for Amgen but neutral for MRK. So the stock price impact on Amgen's future might be positive, while MRK could remain neutral or perhaps not affect the overall stock market much."

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER why did it take so long ? merck scuttles a $ 700m - plus ariad deal and hands back a once-vaunted cancer drug - $ mrk URL"". I see that this tweet is in English and mentions that Merck (MRK) sold a $700 million deal, which might imply they're selling off assets or paying off debts. It also says they handed over a ""once-vaunted"" cancer drug, suggesting they've taken some money from the proceeds of that sale. These are positive actions that could indicate growth or a shift in focus.

Now, looking at the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER why did it take so long ? baba sprints a $ 700m - plus ariad deal and hands back a once-vaunted cancer drug - $ mrk url"". This one is also from MRK. It mentions selling another $700 million, doing an ARIAD group deal, again handing over a once-vaunted cancer drug. So similar content here as the first tweet.

In both tweets, they're discussing Merck's financial activities—specifically, large-scale acquisitions and deals that are part of their business. These seem like significant investments, which could indicate positive news for the stock because it might signal growth or a strategic move to expand into other sectors. Investors might be more cautious about big purchases, but if these transactions align with MRK's long-term goals, they could boost the stock price.

Additionally, both tweets talk about returning ""once-vaunted"" assets, which suggests that MRK is divesting assets and focusing on its future operations. This process of asset management can sometimes signal confidence in the company's ability to sustain growth or to retain focus, all of which are factors that positively impact investor sentiment.

Looking at overall sentiments, since both tweets are about significant financial transactions for Merck, they are likely to convey positive information that could support the stock price. The mention of proceeds from large deals and a strategic return of assets align with what would happen in a healthy company that's making substantial investments."
2014-02-26,Neutral,"Alright, let's break down how I approached this query. The user provided two tweets and asked me to determine their impact on a company's stock price using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I identified the target stock from the tweets. It looks like neither of these tweets mention a specific stock symbol, so I assumed it might be MRK (Microsoft), given the context with Tesla (TSLA) and other financial terms.

Next, I analyzed each tweet separately. The first one talks about a gale breaking down sales for Galena Biopharma and mentions seeking alpha on Twitter. It's pretty technical, focusing on a business development aspect without mentioning any positive or negative implications directly related to stock price movement.

The second tweet provides reports on the MRK stock but focuses on financial metrics and companies (Mids, JPM) without discussing stock performance. The user just gave links, so there's not much content here that could affect investor sentiment.

I realized both tweets are more about company updates or business news than providing actionable information related to the stock price. They don't mention any positive indicators like earnings, analysts' reports, or specific deals they might acquire.

Considering all this, I concluded that neither tweet provides enough context or information to influence the stock's market impact positively, neutrally, or negatively. The content is too neutral and speculative."

2014-03-01,Negative,"Alright, so I need to determine whether each tweet impacts the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for a given company. The user provided a list of tweets and asked me to analyze them. Let's break this down.

First, looking at the target stock symbol—wait, the first tweet is a bunch of stocks with symbols like S&P100, Twx, Mdt, etc., followed by several market indices: $ tgt, $ hal, $ twx, $ mdt, $ unh, $ ms, $ apc, $ cl, $ cof, $ axp, $ mo, $ dd, $ aig, $ ebay, $ gs, mrk, cost, Dow, and APY. That seems like it's not the target stock but multiple indices or ETFs. Hmm, maybe I misread that.

Wait, perhaps each of these is part of the same line of tweets? So the first tweet might be a list of several stocks with symbols separated by commas, followed by other market data. But then in the output requirement, it's asking to conclude on the target stock. That doesn't make sense because there are multiple stocks in one tweet.

Wait, maybe each tweet is about a specific company? Let me check again. The first line has a series of symbols separated by commas: ""s & p100 stocks trend $ tgt $ hal $ twx $ mdt $ unh $ ms $ apc $ cl $ cof $ axp $ mo $ dd $ aig $ ebay $ gs $ mrk $ cost $ dow @ URL"". That looks like a list of stock symbols and market indices. Then the output is about [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe each tweet refers to a specific stock? Let me see: ""s & p100 stocks trend $ tgt $ hal $ twx $ mdt $ unh $ ms $ apc $ cl $ cof $ axp $ mo $ dd $ aig $ ebay $ gs $ mrk $ cost $ dow @ URL""

Ah, perhaps the target stock is one of these symbols: tgt, hal, twx, etc. So maybe each tweet is about whether that specific stock's price is going up or down based on other factors.

But in the output requirement, it says to conclude with a single line stating the overall sentiment for the given stock. But all tweets are part of the same line. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and each tweet refers to different stocks? Or maybe it's one tweet that includes multiple stocks? Let me re-examine: ""s & p100 stocks trend $ tgt $ hal $ twx $ mdt $ unh $ ms $ apc $ cl $ cof $ axp $ mo $ dd $ aig $ ebay $ gs $ mrk $ cost $ dow @ URL""

Yes, that seems like multiple companies listed on the S&P 500 with their stock symbols. But then the output is about the [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative] for a given stock. So perhaps each of these is a separate stock being analyzed in relation to others?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps each tweet pertains to one specific stock, but it's not clear how many or which ones. The user just provided one line with multiple stocks and some market data.

Alternatively, maybe the target stock is implied by the mention of ""s & p100 stocks"" in the first part—so perhaps the given company is the S&P 500 ETF or index?

Wait, but in the output requirement, it's about a specific stock. Maybe I need to look for a single stock symbol and analyze its impact based on all these tweets.

But without knowing which specific stock symbol each tweet refers to, it's hard to assess sentiment. It could be that some tweets are about different stocks than others in the same line.

Wait, perhaps the target stock is one of these symbols: tgt, hal, twx, etc., and the rest are factors influencing that stock. So for example, if a tweet mentions ""the tgt stock,"" it's probably looking at its performance relative to other indices or sectors.

Given that, I think each tweet pertains to whether a specific stock (from those symbols) is performing better or worse than others based on the information provided.

So, perhaps the target stock is one of these: tgt, hal, twx, etc., and each tweet provides an analysis of its performance relative to other factors.

But without knowing which stock each tweet refers to, it's challenging. Maybe I need to assume that all tweets are about the same stock? Or perhaps they're spread across different stocks?

Wait, looking again: ""s & p100 stocks trend $ tgt $ hal $ twx $ mdt $ unh $ ms $ apc $ cl $ cof $ axp $ mo $ dd $ aig $ ebay $ gs $ mrk $ cost $ dow @ URL""

I think each of these symbols is in the same line, so all are part of multiple companies. But again, it's unclear how this relates to the target stock.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe each tweet refers to one specific stock symbol from the list and the rest are context or background info.

But since I don't have that context, maybe I should just analyze each factor in isolation.

Each tweet has factors: positive and negative, and a sentiment assessment on whether those factors influence investor sentiment towards the stock.

So perhaps each of these tweets is about a specific stock's performance based on different factors, like market trends, sectors, or other economic indicators.

Therefore, to assess the overall sentiment, I need to go through all the positive and negative factors for each relevant tweet and sum them up. If more positives than negatives, it's positive; if equal, neutral; if more negatives, negative.

But without knowing which stock is being referred to in the given output line, this becomes a bit ambiguous. It seems that the user provided one line with multiple stocks but wants an analysis for a specific target stock. Perhaps each of these is part of a broader market context for a particular stock.

In any case, I think my approach should be:

1. Identify which tweet refers to the target stock.
2. Extract all positive and negative factors in that tweet.
3. Sum them to determine sentiment.

But since the user provided only one line with multiple stocks, it's unclear which specific stock is being analyzed. Perhaps each factor is about a different stock, so I need more context or specify which one to analyze.

Alternatively, maybe the target stock isn't part of this line but another context is, but that doesn't align with the output requirements either.

I think I'll proceed by analyzing all factors in each tweet and summing them up to get an overall sentiment. If any tweet mentions a specific stock symbol, treat that as the target and analyze based on that. Otherwise, it's spread across multiple stocks.

So I'll go ahead and do that."
2014-03-02,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock price for $MRK, GM, and GME.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. The first tweet is ""thinking of investing in $ mrk $ morn $ gme $ usd research URL"". That seems like it's mentioning stocks: MRK (MSFT), GME (GLP), USDT (USDT), and USD. So, I think the target stock here is likely either GM or USDT because those are the most relevant ones for investment purposes.

Next, I need to break down each tweet into Positive and Negative factors. For this first tweet, it's all about investing in specific stocks. There doesn't seem to be a clear sentiment expressed except maybe some vague mentions like ""thinking"" of investing, which could imply a positive outlook on these stocks but not sure if it's actually influencing investor sentiment.

Then, I should assess the overall sentiment based on each tweet. Since this is all about investments and no direct information on company performance or market trends, the sentiment seems neutral. There's no explicit positive or negative language here.

I don't have other tweets to analyze, so I can only base my conclusion on these two. Without further data, I think it's safe to say that each tweet doesn't indicate a clear direction for stock price movement because they're all about investments without mentioning any specific performance metrics or predictions."
2014-03-03,Missing,File not found
2014-03-04,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on stock prices for a given company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the target stock symbol is ""MSFT"", which is Microsoft. The tweets provided are all about other stocks or topics, so I have to see if any of them mention MSFT explicitly. Scanning through each tweet:

1. weekly dow stocks trend $ unh $ vz $ hd $ dd $ cvx $ utx $ gs $ xom $ nke $ mrk $ axp $ ba $ ko $ ibm $ msft $ trv $ mmm $ jnj @ URL

Looking for ""MSFT"" or anything related to Microsoft. I notice a tweet at the end that mentions ""msft"", so that's definitely a relevant stock.

Now, since only one tweet is provided, it's a bit challenging. But based on the structure of the tweets, they seem like individual statements rather than a report about MSFT. These could be positive or negative statements suggesting investor sentiment towards or against Microsoft.

Looking at each tweet:

- ""weekly dow stocks trend $ unh"": This might indicate a positive view because Dow stocks are up.
- ""$ vz$"", ""$ hd$"", etc., maybe unrelated to MSFT.
- ""gs"", ""xom"", ""nke"" could be sector-specific ETFs, not directly related.
- Other sectors like ""utx"", ""ko"", ""ibm"" again don't connect with Microsoft.

Since these tweets are more about general stock market trends or sector performance rather than any mention of MSFT itself, it's hard to assess their direct impact. However, considering they're all negative in tone and suggesting market movements, even if unrelated, this might influence investor sentiment towards MSFT by affecting the overall market reaction.

But given that none of these tweets specifically mention Microsoft, I'm not sure about the direct impact on its stock price. Maybe it's neutral because they're discussing general market trends without a specific focus on Microsoft."

2014-03-11,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided two tweets and asked to determine their likely effect using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk access pharmaceuticals announces mugard license agreement with hanmi ... URL"". Hmm, ""mrk"" is a company name, and ""pharmaceuticals"" indicates the sector. The exact stock symbol isn't clear yet.

Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. **Tweet 1:** ""$ mrk access pharmaceuticals announces mugard license agreement with hanmi ... URL""

The tweet mentions an upcoming licensing deal between mugard and hanmi. It seems like the company is making a significant announcement about this deal. Licensing agreements can be positive because they often lead to collaborations, partnerships, or joint projects which can boost demand and market share.

2. **Tweet 2:** Not provided, so I'll note that without the exact stock symbol from the first tweet, it's hard to get precise info for the second one. So, maybe there's another stock here?

Wait, in the previous response, I only looked at the first tweet. The user mentioned two tweets but didn't provide both. However, looking back, the original query had two tweets and an output requirement with a specific tag.

Ah, wait, no—the user provided two tweets: ""mrk access..."" and presumably another one, but in their query, it's incomplete. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, actually, the initial query was:

<Output Requirement>
You must do this: Conclude with a single line that states the overall sentiment. Use one of the following tags exactly:
[Positive]
[Neutral]
[Negative]

But then the tweets are given as:

1. $ mrk access pharmaceuticals announces mugard license agreement with hanmi ... URL

2. (empty)

So, only two tweets in total. So perhaps there was a mistake earlier when I considered two tweets.

Wait, maybe it's that one tweet is incomplete or there was an error. But the user provided two tweets but the second was empty. Let me clarify.

First, the first tweet seems to be from mrk access pharmaceuticals announcing a licensing agreement. The positive sentiment here is clear because announcing partnerships often leads to increased demand and potential for growth.

But without the stock symbol, I can't evaluate the impact on the specific company's performance. However, since the user provided an output requirement, perhaps it's about how the tweet affects overall market sentiment or stock price in general.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The first tweet is about mrk access pharmaceuticals, and the second tweet was empty, which might be a typo or incomplete. Maybe the user intended to provide two tweets but forgot one.

In any case, for the given output requirement, perhaps it's just focusing on the impact of this tweet on stock price as [Positive], considering the announcement could positively influence the company's performance and thus its stock price.

But without knowing the exact stock symbol, I can't definitively assign it to a particular stock. However, assuming that this tweet is about mrk access pharmaceuticals, which might be a well-known or active company in the pharmaceutical sector.

In terms of sentiment analysis, the announcement of a licensing agreement could be seen as positive because it's an expected development in their operations and could lead to increased revenue or market share, thereby contributing positively to the stock price.

So, considering all that, I'll conclude with [Positive]."
2014-03-12,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets about a company's stock and determine if they'll impact the future stock price as positive, neutral, or negative. The user provided some tweets, but only one example here: 

""rt AT_USER AT_USER last $ ecyt cc they talked about that data being locked . my guess is they are waiting for mrk to release it . url""

Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the stock symbol is. Looking at the tweets, there's no mention of a specific company, so maybe it's a generic example or perhaps the user forgot to include the actual stock name. Without that information, I might have some issues because each tweet could be referring to different stocks, and I can't determine which one they're talking about.

But wait, if the output requires me to conclude with a single line, I need to figure out what the stock symbol is based on the provided tweets. Maybe the company name is ""ECYT"" or similar? Or maybe it's a typo and should be something else. Without that information, perhaps the analysis isn't possible as the tweet doesn't provide enough context about which stock.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to assume an implied stock symbol from the context. Since there are some mentions of data being locked or waiting for a release, this could relate to companies that deal with confidential information or research departments. Maybe it's a tech company or a financial services firm that releases data reports after a while.

But without knowing the exact stock name, I can't make an accurate analysis. The sentiment is tricky because each tweet alone might not give enough context. If all tweets are about different companies, I can't generalize based on one tweet. It's possible that this is just a single example and needs more context to determine the overall impact.

Wait, perhaps in the actual data, there's another tweet with the specific stock name. Maybe the user missed including it? Or maybe they're referring to the same company across multiple tweets. In any case, without knowing which company the tweet pertains to, I can't assess whether the sentiment is positive or negative towards a particular stock.

I think in this case, since there's only one tweet, and no context about which stock or industry it relates to, it's impossible to determine the overall impact on the future stock price. The user might need more information before making that determination.

So, I'm not sure how to proceed without knowing the exact stock symbol or additional context from other tweets. It seems like a limitation in the given data. Maybe the user can provide another tweet with the company name or specify which stock they're referring to."
2014-03-13,Missing,File not found
2014-03-14,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. So, first, I need to understand what each tweet is about.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk - fda approves merck ’ s noxafil ® ( 18 mg / ml ) f ... -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". Hmm, this seems like a call for action. The user is indicating that FDA has approved Merck's Oxyfill, which is an antipsychotic medication. This could be a positive signal because FDA approvals usually boost stock prices as companies might benefit from regulatory approval. However, I'm not sure how strong the impact will be since it's just one tweet.

The second tweet: ""$ get stock market reports on $ atk $ mrk $ amzn financialnews URL"". This looks like an announcement about upcoming financial reports. If the company is expected to release earnings or financial statements, that could definitely affect investor sentiment positively. They might expect the stock price to rise as it's a key indicator of the company's performance.

Now, putting this together: The first tweet provides information on FDA approvals, which are positive signs. However, only one tweet suggests potential benefits. The second tweet is about upcoming financial reports, which can also be positive because investors often react to earnings before they know their impact on stock price.

So, combining these factors, both tweets indicate positive signals that could positively influence the stock price. There's a mix of information, but each tweet points towards the company being in good standing. I'm leaning towards a [Positive] sentiment overall because all the key pieces are supportive."

2014-03-19,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided two tweets and asked for an analysis based on possible positive, neutral, or negative impacts.

First, let's break down each tweet individually. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk - five prime , bristol-myers squibb cut $ 350m immuno-oncology deal -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". I notice that it mentions a $350 million deal with MedImm, which is a biotechnology company known for its immunotherapy products. The mention of cutting such a significant amount might indicate either positive or negative news.

Now, the second tweet: ""$ mrk fetal-brain protein sparks in old age to fight dementia URL"". This one talks about a medical breakthrough in treating dementia by using fetal brain proteins. This seems promising because advancements in understanding and treatment can positively influence stock prices as companies likely see increased demand or success.

Since both tweets mention deals related to a company's products, it's possible that the overall sentiment is positive for the stock price. The first tweet might provide good news about expanding into new markets, while the second could be a breakthrough in treating a serious condition, which is always seen as positive. Combining these two pieces of positive information from both tweets would likely lead to an upward trend."
2014-03-20,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price for $mrk. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet is: ""$ mrk justice department drops sl industries bribery probe URL"". Hmm, that seems like it's related to a legal matter or regulatory change. The mention of a bribery probe suggests that there might be some legal scrutiny or investigation being conducted. Investors are usually more cautious when there are pending matters, so this could lead to increased uncertainty and possibly a negative impact.

The second tweet is: ""rt AT_USER $ mrk merck exec to boston health it startups : ' don ’ t confuse activity with achievement ' URL via AT_USER"". The user is quoting someone, which might indicate that they're discussing startup discussions. But the phrase ""' don’t confuse activity with achievement'"" sounds like a reminder or warning against conflating the two. If investors are being told not to mix these terms in their talks, it could create confusion and hinder progress, leading to negative sentiment.

Putting both together, both tweets point towards increased scrutiny or uncertainty about $mrk's operations or future plans. They're likely signaling that there might be internal or external issues that investors need to keep an eye on. This would generally lead to a negative outlook because the company might face challenges or delays in progress."
2014-03-21,Neutral,"Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user has given me some tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on stock price using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Hmm, first I should figure out how they're structured because the target stock symbol isn't provided. But maybe the topics in the tweets can give clues.

Looking at the tweets: ""nvs is growing in generic drug business azn pfe mrk url url"". That's pretty vague. Both nvs and pfe are names of companies, maybe pharmaceuticals? Azn could be an authentication company or something tech-related. I'm not sure about those. The URLs might link to some products or data.

Wait, maybe these tweets are from investors or analysts who think the stock is going up. But without knowing which stocks they're talking about or any relevant news related to them, it's hard to tell if they're positive, negative, or neutral.

I remember that when analyzing Twitter trends for stock sentiment, you look for words like ""growing"", ""expanding"", ""positive"", or "" downtrodden"". The more positive factors, the higher the chance of a positive outcome. But here, I don't see any such indicators. It seems like just some unrelated topics.

Maybe they're related to broader sectors, but without context, it's impossible to assess their impact on a specific stock. If there was a pattern or keyword that suggested a positive trend in those companies' recent performance, that could help, but as it is, I can't conclude anything definitive.

I should probably mention that the provided data isn't sufficient for an accurate analysis without more context about which stocks they're referring to and what broader trends are affecting them. So, my conclusion would be Neutral because the information given doesn't support a clear positive or negative trend."

2014-03-23,Missing,File not found
2014-03-24,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets affect the stock price of a company. The user provided three tweets and wants me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on the stock's future value.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions ""mrk"" which sounds like a generic name for a company, maybe a pharmaceutical firm.
2. The second tweet talks about erbitux and mentions some unions and partnerships with other companies: $ lly & $ bmy & exus by $ mrk - who's left? It seems like this is from the Wall Street Journal or similar because of the ""w"" symbols in the dollar signs, which are often part of financial news.
3. The third tweet is about merck presenting new data on treatments for investigational hepatitis C: mk - 5172 & mk - 8742 at easl annual.

So, the target stock seems to be ""mrk"", which might be Merck. But I should note that in my analysis because it's the symbol used throughout the tweets.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: It says i think $ mrk is just ~ 1 year behind $ gild ... and mentions Oral probably. The mention of ""gild"" could be referring to Gilead Sciences or another company. The fact that $ mrk has been around for a few years, even losing some approvals, might suggest instability. Also, the idea that they're behind Gilead by one year could imply that Merck is a bit weaker in this area. Investors often look at how companies are tracking against major peers, and if Merck lags, it can affect their stock price.

Second tweet: The user mentions erbitux revenues from $ lly & $ bmy & exus by $ mrk - who's left? The mention of unions like Halo, Rhhby, Pfe, Bax indicates a merger or acquisition situation. If these companies are involved in mergers, it could impact the stock price because the deal might be structured differently or affect Merck's operations. This seems to involve big companies and potential financial adjustments.

Third tweet: $ mrk is presenting data on treatments for hepatitis C. Merck often has strong pharmaceutical products, including hepatitis C treatments. If they're updating their research or data releases, this could either boost the stock price if it aligns with market expectations or cause some concern if there are regulatory changes or updates in a non-traditional area like health.

Now, assessing each tweet:

1. The first tweet talks about Merck's lag and Oral's possible role, which is about their ability to get approvals. This could affect stock price as Merck might face pressure from Gilead for funding or approval timelines.
2. The second tweet involves a merger-related revenue decline. It might cause concerns because mergers can be volatile and impact the company's financial health. Investors watch for how these deals are handled and if they align with their expectations.
3. The third tweet is about Merck presenting data on hepatitis C treatments. This could either positively or negatively affect the stock depending on market interest. If Merck has a strong product line, it might boost sentiment positively.

Combining these factors:

- The first tweet mentions Merck being behind Gilead, which is a significant issue for Merck's stock.
- The second tweet involves potential merger-related news, which can be stressful but not necessarily negative if viewed as part of a broader economic trend.
- The third tweet introduces Merck's ongoing research in a specific area, which could indicate confidence in their product line.

However, the first tweet directly relates to Merck's position relative to Gilead, which is a major competitor. This situation might indicate that Merck is not performing well relative to peers, which can lead some investors to expect negative sentiment as they see Merck falling behind. But it doesn't outright state whether the stock will go up or down.

The second tweet is about potential mergers, which can fluctuate in impact on investor sentiment depending on how the market reacts. Some may be seen as opportunities, while others might lead to defaults or reputational issues.

The third tweet adds another layer of positive information if it's considered a new product line that could attract attention or fill a perceived gap.

Overall, while there are multiple factors affecting Merck's stock price, each tweet contributes somewhat positively and negatively. The first tweet is more about relative performance against peers, the second about potential risks from mergers, and the third adds to merck's product line strengths.

I don't see a clear overall trend that would tip the balance in favor of positive or negative sentiment. It seems like Merck might have mixed signals but could remain stable or perhaps have some upward momentum due to their new research but also faces challenges from Gilead and potential merger risks."
2014-03-25,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, the user has provided some tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on a stock's future price using a scale from Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk cisco , big pharma lead the dow's pop URL."" Wait, that seems incomplete. Maybe it's a typo. It might be $mrk cisco, which is a symbol for a company, perhapsmrk is the ticker and cisco is the stock. So, maybe the target stock is Cisco Corporation?

Next step, I need to analyze each tweet. But wait, there's only one tweet here: ""$ mrk cisco , big pharma lead the dow's pop URL."" Hmm, not sure what this tweet is about. It mentions $mrk cisco and ""big pharma lead the dow's pop URL."" That doesn't seem relevant to Cisco or any other company related to stock trading.

Wait, maybe it's a typo for something else. Perhaps it should be ""$ mrk cisco leading big pharma"" or another relevant keyword? Without more context, it's hard to assess the sentiment from this single tweet. It might not provide enough information about how Cisco would affect the stock price.

Since there are no other tweets provided, I can't accurately determine the overall impact on Cisco's future stock price. The user must have intended a different set of tweets or more information before sending these out in the future.

In conclusion, without sufficient data points or relevant tweets related to the target stock, it's impossible to make an accurate analysis. Maybe the user should provide more tweets or clarify which tweet is relevant to the stock they're interested in."
2014-03-26,Missing,File not found
2014-03-27,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company, which I think is Markers, Inc., based on the information provided. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the user mentioned that the target stock is Markers, Inc., with the ticker symbol MRK. So my job is to assess how these tweets might affect its future stock price.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk merck & co . , inc . ( nyse : mrk ) to pay $ 100m as settlement fees for its ... URL"". Hmm, this seems like a financial announcement about upcoming expenses. They're mentioning they'll pay $100 million in settlement fees. In the context of stock prices, paying settlement fees could be related to meeting obligations or preparing for future transactions. This might influence investor confidence but not necessarily push them higher or lower; it's more of an operational update rather than a positive or negative news event.

Now, moving on to the second tweet: ""AT_USER $ celg 11x ' s 2016 ' s < $ mrk $ pfe . 0.3 peg on 2017 ' s ( growthAT_USER discount ) ... stupidcheap soon 5 bill $ / yr drugs . s & p's best grmar %"". This one is a bit confusing. The term ""stupidcheap"" suggests that the user is referring to something that's been discounted or made cheap, which might affect the stock price. However, the mention of AT_USER could be a typo or referring to an unrelated entity. The part about growth and discount on MRK seems to indicate potential negative sentiment because of the discount being applied. If investors perceive this as a good deal or a favorable offer, it could boost the stock. But if they think it's misinformed or misleading, it might lead to uncertainty.

Putting both together: The first tweet provides an obligation related to future costs, which is neutral. The second seems to hint at potential discounts, which can be seen as either positive (good deal) or negative (misinformation). Since the user didn't specify whether it's good or bad, but given that it's a discount on MRK, it could influence investor perception.

However, considering the overall sentiment, if the discount is based on market trends and not something absurd, like ""stupidcheap,"" it might still be seen as positive. But if it's misused, even though the user said 0.3 peg on 2017, which doesn't make much financial sense in this context, it could create confusion.

I think overall, while the first tweet is neutral about future costs, the second might add a bit of uncertainty or negative perception due to the discount and the user's actions. Without more context, it's hard to be certain, but leaning towards a mix."

2014-03-30,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets impact the future stock price of the company. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: $ mrk - new drugs to lower cholesterol show promise : studies URL. Hmm, this seems positive because it's talking about new drugs lowering cholesterol levels, which is a good health indicator. That suggests better health outcomes, so maybe investors are hopeful about the company's future performance.

Now, let me think about each tweet one by one. The first one talks about new drugs for cholesterol. That sounds like good news because it could lead to better health scores and possibly lower costs or higher demand for their products. This positive point might boost investor confidence.

Are there other tweets I should check? Well, the user didn't provide more, so maybe just focusing on this one is enough. It seems like a solid sign of improvement in the company's potential, especially if these drugs are effective and have health benefits.

I shouldn't ignore any factors here. Even though it doesn't mention specific financial data or sales numbers, the positive announcement about cholesterol lowering is significant. It shows the company can develop beneficial products, which is a good sign for investors expecting future success.

Putting this all together, I think the overall impact is definitely a positive one. The tweet highlights a promising direction in their health-related product development, so it should positively influence the stock price."
2014-03-31,Missing,File not found
2014-04-01,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user provided two tweets and wants me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for future stock price.

First, let's look at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet is ""$ mrk buena vista county ~ january - march 2014 claims listing URL"". It seems like a listing announcement. The word ""claims"" here probably means that the stock is being listed on a new platform or something related to their operations. That would be a positive sign because more information about the company could help investors make decisions.

The second tweet is ""$ mrk $ pfe"". This looks like a comparison of dividends between two pharmaceutical giants: Merck and PFE. The user is asking which has the better dividend. While this is interesting, it's more of an internal business question rather than a direct signal about the stock price. It might influence investor sentiment by affecting their expectations but isn't a major external factor that affects the stock directly.

Now, combining these two tweets, the first one provides positive information about the company's list and potentially future performance, while the second tweet could add some transparency or perspective on financials which can affect investor views. 

I think the overall sentiment here is positive because the listing announcement likely gives some clarity and data that investors would want to see before making a decision. The comparison of dividends might be secondary but could contribute by giving different perspectives on the company's financial health.

So, considering both factors, I'll conclude it's a positive impact."
2014-04-02,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me break down the steps I took.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at both tweets, they don't directly mention any specific stock symbol like GSK, PFE, or others. That means either the information isn't provided, or maybe it's inferred based on context. Since the exact stock is unknown, I can't extract a clear target. So, I should consider this as a problem where the target isn't identifiable from the tweets.

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate them into Positive and Negative factors. In the first tweet, there are mentions like ""url … p3 fail ! ! ! URL $ oxgn undervalued gem"" which might suggest that the company's stock is undervalued or maybe not being featured. The words ""valued"" could imply that the stock might be seen as a good investment. Then, the second tweet talks about an article by the user on immunotherapy, which is a positive sentiment towards the product but doesn't directly mention a stock.

After identifying factors in each tweet, I'll assess the sentiment. The first tweet has mixed feelings: it's undervalued and also mentions something about the company being featured. This could mean both potential benefits for investors and some skepticism. The second tweet is more straightforward; it's a positive article on immunotherapy by the user but doesn't mention a stock.

Now, combining these factors into an overall sentiment summary. While the first tweet hints at undervaluation, which might be seen as a good thing, there are also negative signs like the URL issues and not being featured. The second tweet is more positive, encouraging others to read more on immunotherapy. However, without knowing exactly what's being asked about, it's hard to determine if these tweets relate to a specific stock.

Since I can't identify the target stock and only have information based on URLs or product mentions, my analysis might not be accurate for any particular company. This is why I marked it as [Neutral] because there's insufficient information to make a precise conclusion about the stock price impact."
2014-04-03,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. Let me start by breaking down what's given.

First, each tweet is a separate entity. The user wants me to process all of them together, but in this case, there are only three tweets. So, I'll have to look at each one individually before combining my thoughts.

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER mikaela is running out of options to treat her cancer . will AT_USER help ? URL $ mrk wegotthis""

Hmm, breaking this down, it seems like a user, AT_USER, is mentioning someone named mikaela who can't find treatments for their cancer. They're asking if AT_USER will help and then append ""URL $ mrk wegotthis."" I don't know much about AT_USER, but the content here looks like it's promoting something or suggesting an action.

The part after ""will"" seems like a request to take some action, maybe a trade, offer, or investment. The URL suggests they might be targeting a specific stock with mrk. So, could this tweet be related to a news story about that stock?

Looking at the other tweets: ""rt AT_USER mikaela is running out of options..."" and ""mrk wegotthis"". Wait, ""wegotthis"" doesn't seem familiar. Maybe that's part of a typo or incorrect data.

Putting it together, these tweets are pointing towards a potential news story about mikaela's treatments for cancer and whether AT_USER will assist them. The mention of mrk might be related to a specific stock in the company, perhaps a dividend or a performance metric they're tracking.

I need to assess each tweet's sentiment. ""Running out of options"" suggests uncertainty or difficulty, which could indicate negative sentiment if it affects investor confidence. But then, the request is about helping, which might imply optimism or hope that the user will offer assistance.

Considering that AT_USER is asking for help and the tweets are appending a URL with ""mrk wegotthis,"" I wonder if this is part of a strategy to promote an investment opportunity or news related to the company. The combination of uncertainty and a positive action request might lead to mixed feelings, but leaning more towards hope.

Overall, these tweets seem to be providing information that could influence investor sentiment positively because they're suggesting potential help from AT_USER, which might mean they think there's potential for growth. However, without specific context about the company or their performance, it's hard to say if it's definitely positive.

I should also consider any other factors like market conditions, news events related to mikaela and cancer treatments, but since that information isn't in the tweets, I have to work with what's provided.

So, after analyzing each tweet and considering the overall context, I think these tweets are likely promoting something, suggesting there might be opportunities or potential growth. Therefore, my conclusion is that they have a positive impact on the stock price."
2014-04-04,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets will have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on Merck's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. The first one mentions that Merck wants to test Zilmax on 240,000 cattle but is resisting the beef industry URL via AT_USER $ mrk. Hmm, interesting. So they're testing a new medicine and facing backlash in the beef industry. That sounds like they might be trying to maintain some control or stability despite criticism. Maybe that's a positive sign because it could attract more patients.

The second tweet is about tracking PFE, Unt, MRK, CAG views on the current stock price. It says $ mrk - 3 under-loved dividends for your portfolio -> URL stock stocks stockaction. I'm not sure what ""url"" refers to here. Maybe they're just updating their portfolio status? This could be a neutral or maybe even positive because it's about managing investments, which is always seen as positive.

The third tweet says $ mrk - 3 under-loved dividend darlings for your portfolio -> URL stock stocks stockaction. Again, unclear. They're talking about dividends and selling stock action. Dividends are good for investors, so maybe this could be a boost to their confidence in the stock. That might contribute positively.

The fourth tweet is asking if I'm considering buying $ pii $ mrk $ pm $ s click URL. It seems like they want to buy Merck and possibly others as well. Buying shares directly can definitely influence the stock price, especially if they're looking for a big move. This could push up their stock price positively.

Putting it all together: The first tweet shows potential stability or control from Merck despite criticism. The second mentions managing investments, which is positive. The third talks about dividends, which are good. The fourth wants to buy shares directly, so that's definitely a strong signal for an upward movement. So overall, I think this will be positive."
2014-04-05,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out whether the given tweet is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of impact on the stock price. Let me break down how I would approach this.

First, looking at the tweet: ""reg retting your investment in $ dwa $ srcl $ grpn click URL"". Hmm, that seems a bit odd and maybe even offensive. The mention of $dwa$ is a symbol for a cryptocurrency, which could be triggering a negative thought bubble because it's not something many people are familiar with.

Then there's ""reg retting your investment in ..."", which probably means the person regretted their investment decision. But since they're talking about $dwa$, this might imply that someone who doesn't know much about cryptocurrency is making decisions based on vague terms or misinformation. That would definitely create anxiety and make people doubt their decisions.

The part ""click URL"" suggests an action, but it's unclear what the URL is intended for. Maybe a link to a negative investment site? The mention of ""click URL"" again could be another way of encouraging someone to skip the decision because they don't know where to click. That would definitely add to the negative sentiment.

Putting this together, the tweet is clearly trying to undermine confidence in the stock price by using terms related to cryptocurrency that might lead to misinformation or anxiety. This lack of clarity and possibly targeting individuals with a limited knowledge base would likely result in a negative impact on investor sentiment."
2014-04-06,Negative,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to analyze these tweets and determine if they will impact the future stock price of a company. The possible responses are Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, looking at the target stock symbol—oh wait, there aren't any symbols provided in the tweets yet. Hmm, that's an issue because I can't actually analyze anything about the stock itself unless I know its name. Maybe this is part of a larger context or perhaps it was supposed to be included earlier? I'll have to keep that in mind.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk data show pdl 1 makes tumors respond much more to pd - 1 drugs , but there is still response in non-pdl 1 patients . aacr 14"". Okay, it mentions something about MRK stock data. It talks about PDL 1 and TUMORS responding differently to drugs. But without knowing the exact company or industry, I can't say much. Maybe if MRK is a medical tech stock, but that's speculative.

The second tweet: ""$ mrk merck wants to test zilmax on 240000 cattle but beef industry resists URL"". This seems more specific. It mentions MRK Merck testing ZILMAX on large numbers of cattle, which might be related to their agricultural products or healthcare. Then, it's talking about the beef industry resisting a URL... Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe they meant something else? Or perhaps ""resist"" is referring to regulatory issues or competition?

Given these tweets, I can see both are mentioning MRK Merck, which could be a company in the healthcare or pharmaceutical sector. The first tweet talks about drug response studies and tumor response to drugs, which might indicate their product performance or research focus. The second tweet seems more about marketing strategies on cattle, but that's specific.

Since the user didn't provide a target stock symbol, I'm unsure how much analysis is possible here. But if it's about MRK Merck, perhaps the first tweet could hint at their effectiveness in treatments related to tumors or drugs, which might influence investor sentiment positively if the stock is expected to perform well.

The second tweet mentions testing ZILMAX on a large number of cattle and potential regulatory issues or competition resistance. If they're concerned about regulations or competition, that could be a negative factor, but it's not directly linked to the company's performance unless it affects their reputation.

I'm confused because without knowing the target stock, I can't assess the impact. Maybe there was an earlier part where the target stock symbol was provided? Without that, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the given tweets. But this could be misleading if other factors are at play.

In summary, unless there's a specific company in mind, it's challenging to determine the sentiment from these tweets alone. However, focusing on potential positive aspects like drug efficacy or market research could indicate a favorable outlook."

2014-04-08,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for a company's stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet is: ""looking for research on $ mrk $ vtr $ ati $ ci goto url"". Hmm, the words here are MRK, VTR, ATI, and GOTO. I'm not sure if these refer to anything specific or common. Maybe they're abbreviations of something like MSCI, which stands for market sector index, or perhaps they're unrelated terms. Since they don't seem to indicate any positive or negative information, it's probably neutral.

The second tweet is: ""mrk stock: what do you think about their research on mrk"". This seems like a direct question about the company's research. It's prompting someone to share their thoughts or opinions, which could lead to a more positive sentiment if there's mutual trust or information sharing among investors. But it's not explicitly stated whether this tweet adds to stock performance, so I'm leaning towards [Neutral] because it doesn't present any clear information about the stock.

Putting it together, both tweets are asking for something that isn't provided. The first one is vague and neutral, and the second is a request without specifics. So overall, it's likely [Neutral] as neither adds positive nor negative information."
2014-04-09,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll look at the target stock symbol from the tweets. All the tweets mention $ mrk, which I believe stands for Microsoft Corporation's symbol. So the target stock is Microsoft (MSFT).

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet talks about Microsoft starting a one-pill trial and mentions potential future gains.
2. The second tweet repeats similar information as the first one.
3. The third tweet focuses on Gilead, ERSX, and Abbvax, but it's unrelated to the target stock of Microsoft.
4. The fourth tweet is the same as the previous ones about Microsoft's trial.
5. This pattern continues with multiple tweets mentioning Microsoft starting their trial and potential gains.

Then there are a few other tweets:

6. A mention of ""penny stock alerts gained 2,100%"" in four weeks.
7. Another similar alert tweet.
8. Yet another alert tweet.
9. A different one, but same message.
10. The user is asking to subscribe for a breakout on Insy.com and Microsoft.
11-15 are all about Microsoft's trial, some with ""Son"" mentioned.

All these tweets seem to be promoting Microsoft's stock as potentially gaining value because of their upcoming trial or alert. There's no negative information here; it seems focused on optimism about the company's potential growth.

There are also mentions of other companies like Gilead and ERSX, but those don't relate to Microsoft. The user isn't explicitly stating a concern about Microsoft, so I shouldn't assume any negative sentiment based on those tweets alone.

Considering all the information, the tweets are all about Microsoft stock starting a trial and expecting gains, which are positive signals for investors. There's no indication of uncertainty or lack of clarity, so the overall impact is positive."
2014-04-10,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of $mrk.

First, I need to understand what each tweet is about. Looking at the tweets, they all mention the lab abnormalities in the dosing arms or new data from $mrk regarding hepatitis c treatment. Each one seems to be providing information about the effectiveness of a medication or the company's performance metrics.

Each tweet also has some variations with hashtags like # mrk and mentions other companies (like abbv, bmy, jnj) as part of their narrative. However, many tweets are repeating similar points, which means they might not add much new information beyond what's already stated in others.

The analysis is done by evaluating each tweet for Positive and Negative factors. The tweets are mostly positive about the effectiveness of $mrk's treatments but lack negative feedback. So, I don't see any negative factors here.

Looking at the overall sentiment, since all the tweets are reinforcing the same positive information without conflicting or contradicting each other, it seems like they're contributing to a supportive environment for the stock price.

There aren't any mentions of technical issues, financial news, or anything that would suggest the company is underperforming. The focus is on the medication's effectiveness and the company's performance metrics, both of which are positive signs.

I should also consider if there's any mention of market trends or other external factors influencing the stock, but the tweets don't indicate any specific events or news related to the company that would make the stock more favorable. They just provide information about $mrk and its treatments.

Putting it all together, each tweet is a slight positive update on $mrk's performance in drug treatments, which generally can be seen as an indicator of a healthy stock with positive trends. Therefore, the overall sentiment should be neutral since there's no significant negative news or conflicting information."
2014-04-11,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided some tweets and asked for an analysis of their likely impact on a company's stock price using three possible outcomes: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet because that's crucial for determining which company we're talking about. Scanning through the tweets:

1. ""small-cap stocks breaking 52 - wk high prices $ tol $ mrk $ orly $ ir financial URL""
   - This seems to reference Microsoft (MSFT), as it's spelled with an 's' and has a financial context.

2. ""should you buy , sell or hold $ fdx $ awk $ mrk $ ibm investing URL""
   - Again, ""fdx"" is likely a typo for ""fdg"", which refers to Facebook (FB). However, the tweet mentions investments, so it might be about Microsoft again since that's common in investment discussions.

3. ""s & p100 stocks trend $ cop $ mcd $ dvn $ so $ cl $ ko $ ibm $ t $ hpq $ csco $ aep $ mdlz $ pg $ mo $ spg $ pep $ cat $ pm $ mrk @ URL""
   - This includes Microsoft, among others. The tweet mentions ""trend"" and mentions several companies.

4. ""rt AT_USER top-read fp news thurs : reckitt may top novartis , sanofi in $ 12b race for merck consumer unit URL $ mrk …""
   - This tweet is about Microsoft's performance, specifically mentioning the Merck Consumer Unit (MCU). It talks about a $12 billion race between Reke接 and Novartis.

5. ""latest earnings info on $ twc $ mrk $ fast $ yod stockmarket URL""
   - Again, this mentions Microsoft due to its presence in the earnings report.

So, the target stocks seem to be Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (multiple times), and possibly others like Reke接 or Novartis if applicable. 

Next, I'll analyze each tweet for Positive, Negative, or Neutral factors. The goal is to assess the sentiment towards these companies as a group.

1. ""small-cap stocks breaking 52 - wk high prices $ tol $ mrk $ orly $ ir financial URL""
   - This tweet suggests that small-cap stocks are doing well in the past week and mentions several financials, which could indicate growth potential but doesn't specify negative factors.

2. ""should you buy , sell or hold $ fdx $ awk $ mrk $ ibm investing URL""
   - The mention of investments leads me to think about Microsoft's role in investment activities. However, no explicit negative words are present here, so it might be neutral regarding this company but could have an impact on others.

3. ""s & p100 stocks trend $ cop $ mcd $ dvn $ so $ cl $ ko $ ibm $ t $ hpq $ csco $ aep $ mdlz $ pg $ mo $ spg $ pep $ cat $ pm $ mrk @ URL""
   - Similar to the first tweet, it mentions Microsoft's presence in various sectors and mentions market trends. This could indicate positive sentiment but might not be solely focused on Microsoft.

4. ""rt AT_USER top-read fp news thurs : reckitt may top novartis , sanofi in $ 12b race for merck consumer unit URL $ mrk …""
   - This tweet specifically mentions Microsoft (releasings financial results) and includes a mention of Reke接, which is part of Microsoft's business. It might be seen as positive because it highlights the company's performance.

5. ""latest earnings info on $ twc $ mrk $ fast $ yod stockmarket URL""
   - Another reference to Microsoft's earnings report, indicating good performance but without any negative comments here.

Now, considering all these tweets, I need to assess how they collectively impact the stock price of a single company. If we take Microsoft as the target, it seems that multiple tweets are referencing its performance, especially regarding its financial results (earnings) and investment activities. However, none of these tweets explicitly mention negative factors or predictions of worse-than-expected performance.

Considering all positive aspects, like good earnings reports, strong market presence, and potential expansion into new sectors, the sentiment is likely positive for Microsoft. The fact that some mentions of other companies (like Reke接 or Novartis) don't indicate a clear shift in sentiment but could imply broader growth within those areas.

Since the primary focus is on Microsoft's performance without extreme negative language, it leans towards a positive overall impact."
2014-04-12,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the company's stock price. Let me start by breaking down what I know.

First, there are two tweets provided. I need to analyze each one step by step. The process involves identifying the target stock symbol and then going through each tweet to assess positive, negative factors, and sentiment. Finally, combine everything to determine if it's Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER retweet if you joined AT_USER campaign to AT_USER to get cancer treatment for his wife : URL $ mrk we …"" Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. The user mentions retweets and joining a campaign related to getting cancer treatment for his wife. But I'm not sure what the target stock is here because there's no mention of the stock symbol. Maybe it's an internal account or something else? If I don't know the stock symbol, how can I determine its impact on the actual stock price?

Looking at the second tweet: ""did you lose money on $ pii $ mrk $ blk $ grpn click URL"" This also seems disjointed and lacks context. The hashtags mentioned like $pii$ might be related to something specific, but it's unclear. Again, without knowing which company this refers to or what the stock symbol is, I can't really assess its impact on a real stock.

So, both tweets are pretty vague. There's no target stock provided. That makes me think that these tweets don't provide enough information about the company in question to evaluate their impact on the stock price. Without knowing which specific stock or company we're talking about, it's impossible to determine if there's a positive, negative, or neutral effect.

Maybe I'm missing something here. Perhaps the user is referring to a specific context or a known company that I'm not aware of. If I had more information about the company or its current status, like whether it's performing well, facing challenges, etc., I could better assess the impact. But with the given tweets alone, I don't have enough data to make an accurate prediction.

In conclusion, without knowing the target stock symbol from the first tweet and lacking context in the second tweet, neither can I accurately determine their overall sentiment on the company's future stock price."

2014-04-14,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The tweet provided is: ""rt AT_USER +425,000 people are asking AT_USER to help 25 - year-old mikaela fight cancer : URL $ mrk wegotthis"". 

First, I'll break down the components. It looks like this tweet is part of a Twitter account named AT_USER and it's using some hashtags that might indicate the sentiment towards the stock. The key elements here are ""+425,000 people are asking..."" which seems to suggest that a large number of people from that region are responding or taking action regarding mikaela fighting cancer.

The mention of ""mrk"" could refer to the company's ticker symbol. The phrase ""wegotthis"" might indicate support or agreement with the tweet, implying that investors are optimistic about the stock performance based on this tweet.

Since the tweet is from a Twitter account targeting people in a specific region and mentions a positive response or action, it suggests investor sentiment towards the stock is positive. This could lead to an overall [Positive] sentiment for the stock price."
2014-04-15,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided two tweets and wants an analysis on their impact on the stock price of a company. They also want a conclusion using one of three tags: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions ""mrk wins fda ok for fda grastek timothy grass pollen allergen extract sublingual tablet URL pharma biotech allergies."" It seems like MRK is mentioned with mentions of FDA approvals and other agricultural issues related to allergens.

The second tweet is a retweet: ""rt AT_USER merck : feu vert des autorités pour la vente du grastek , concurrent d'oralair bourse finance $ mrk URL"" This reinforces the focus on Mr. Merck and their approval from authorities, especially in agricultural areas like grass pollen allergens.

Now, I need to separate factors for each tweet. For the first tweet, positive factors could be FDA approvals, regulatory support, and marketing efforts. Negative factors might include potential supply chain issues or partnerships that negatively impact MRK's operations. The second tweet is mostly supportive but doesn't mention anything negative.

Next, assessing sentiment: Both tweets are strongly positive with mentions of regulations and authorities' approval. They don't present any negative information.

Putting it together, the overall sentiment should be Positive because both tweets positively highlight key factors like FDA approvals and regulatory support."
2014-04-16,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price. Let me break down each tweet.

First tweet is ""could be breaktout time on $ tso $ tpx $ mrk $ ibm i suggest URL"". It seems like someone is suggesting that maybe they're going to update their URL or something, possibly related to stock information. The word ""breakout"" makes me think of a positive event where the stock price could jump significantly.

The second tweet is ""could be breaktout time on $ tso $ tpx $ mrk $ ibm i suggest URL"". Similar structure; same suggestion about an update or potential change. It reinforces the idea that there's some information to come, which would likely affect the stock positively.

Putting these together, both tweets are providing updates and possibly information that could lead to a favorable outcome for the stock. Since they're suggesting something positive, it indicates investor confidence is building, leading me to conclude this as [Positive]."
2014-04-17,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on a company's stock price. Let me start by understanding each tweet separately.

The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER heads-up ! AT_USER onsite today w / AT_USER jlabssd $ mrk for AT_USER scicafe on stemcells live tweeting …"" The user seems to be updating the Twitter handle, which might indicate a positive engagement or update about the company. But I'm not sure if this is a meaningful tweet from the company itself.

The second tweet says ""$ mrk dear jenny mccarthy , here's how many lives could be saved cheaply by making vaccines more widely available URL"". This seems like an advertisement for something, possibly a vaccine or a research paper. The mention of saving ""how many lives"" suggests they're offering free information to potentially save lives, which is positive in the context of public health but might not directly affect stock performance.

I should consider each tweet's content and intent. The first one could be about the company's announcements or updates on their tweets. The second tweet seems promotional for a vaccine idea. However, neither tweet provides any concrete information that would directly influence the company's financials. They're more about social media engagement and possibly future product launches.

So, putting it all together, since both tweets don't present any specific information that would impact the stock price negatively or positively, I think the overall sentiment is neutral."

2014-04-19,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Centene corp, Merck & Co., and Endo Co. The user provided three tweets with stock symbols and some URLs, but the main focus is on the target stock: CNE, MRK, and END.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol for each tweet. Let's break them down:

1. ""stocks buzz - centene corp ( nyse : cnc ) , merck & co . , inc ( nyse : mrk ) , endo ... $ mrk URL""

Looking at this, the main target seems to be Centene Corp, which is identified as CNE on the NYSE symbol. So, I'll focus on CNE.

2. ""stock market buzz - merck & co . , inc ( nyse : mrk ) , endo ... $ mrk URL""

Here, it mentions Merck and Co., but again, since we're focusing on Centene, this tweet is less relevant unless there's a connection I'm missing. Maybe it's not impacting CNE directly.

3. ""stocks buzz - endo co. , nyse : endo ... $ endo url""

This one is about Endo Co. which isn't our target stock either. So, perhaps the tweets are more related to broader market trends affecting other companies.

Next step: separating positive and negative factors for each tweet that could influence CNE's stock price.

For the first tweet:
- Positive factor: ""stocks buzz"" indicating general market interest or optimism.
- Negative factors: Not explicitly mentioned here. It doesn't mention anything about the company itself, so maybe negligible.

Considering the broader market, if stocks are generally buzzed about, it could indicate positive sentiment, which might lead to increased investor interest in CNE.

But wait, looking again, the URL mentions $ mrk, which is Merck & Co., but since we're focusing on CNE, I should disregard this unless there's a typo or misinterpretation. Maybe ""mrk"" was a typo and it refers to CNE? Let me check.

No, it says ""CNC"", so it's definitely CNE.

Now, for the second tweet: It mentions Merck & Co., which is outside our target stock, so I'll focus on the first and third tweets unless something stands out. The third tweet mentions Endo Co., but again, not relevant to CNE.

Considering that, perhaps the positive ""stocks buzz"" sentiment could influence investor confidence in Centene, leading to a positive impact on their stock price.

Additionally, factors like increased interest from investors or market trends might boost expectations about future performance.

So, putting it all together: The general buzz suggests optimism and potential for higher stock prices. While not explicitly mentioning CNE's positive factors, the broader context of stock activity could still be considered a positive signal.

Therefore, I'm leaning towards a Positive overall sentiment."

2014-04-21,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. So, both tweets are from AT_USER and mention that over 10,000 people are asking them to help a ten-year-old boy fighting cancer. That's pretty alarming. The user is emphasizing their commitment, but I need to consider what kind of information this could lead to.

First, the tweet is addressing a significant public health issue with an exploding population of children affected by cancer. This seems like it's encouraging support and community response. However, the language is very negative—using words like ""help"" and ""cancer"" makes me think it might be aimed at minimizing harm or securing funding.

But wait, I should also consider how investors react to such a statement. When there's a lot of public pressure from people who care about children and cancer, that can create a sense of urgency. Investors might see this as a signal to act quickly, which could lead to more resources being directed towards the project or further fundraising efforts.

On the flip side, the tweet doesn't provide any specific information about the cause or how to help, just stating the public's support and concern. This could lead some investors to think it's an indication that the company has a plan but is not providing concrete details. If they're too quick to jump to conclusions without more context, it might seem like poor planning or lack of transparency.

Also, with so many people involved—10,000 people—are we talking about a large team contributing their efforts? That could mean that the company is taking substantial action, possibly from scratch or through partnerships. But again, without specific details, it's hard to gauge how significant this impact might be.

I remember reading somewhere that when investors receive multiple tweets from the same user emphasizing the same issue, it can create a sense of collective responsibility and urgency. It might prompt them to take actions they weren't taking before, which could have both positive (investors are acting) and negative (maybe some reactions from stock price) outcomes.

Considering all this—public pressure, potential for urgency, and the lack of specific information—it seems like there's a mix of possible signals. On one hand, it might be a sign that they're serious about the cause but not providing clear direction on how to proceed. On the other hand, it could indicate support without concrete plans, which might lead some investors to react positively by taking measures.

However, I'm leaning towards the more immediate and positive response because of the high number of people involved. That might actually accelerate their actions, potentially leading to a more significant impact on the stock price than anticipated."
2014-04-22,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and figure out how they'll impact the stock price for a given company. Let's see, the first tweet is ""whats going on with $ mrk $ spw $ ndsn $ qlys try this URL"". Hmm, that looks like it might be related to some stock symbols: mrk could be Marvel, spw is probably SPW, which I think stands for something like SPW Inc. or maybe a different index. Then ndsn and qlys don't seem familiar. It seems a bit random with some unknown variables. The word ""try"" might be a typo or placeholder. So this tweet is probably not giving me any meaningful information about the company.

Since there are no clear positive or negative factors in this tweet, it doesn't provide enough context to assess sentiment. It's too vague and could relate to something else I'm unaware of. Therefore, without specific information about the stock, I can't determine if this will be a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the price.

Now, considering that other tweets might have more concrete information, but as they are right now, none offer any insights. So the overall sentiment from these tweets is probably [Neutral] because there's no meaningful data to indicate a trend."
2014-04-23,Positive,"Alright, let's analyze these tweets about $ mrk (MSFT). 

First, I'll extract the stock symbol, which is ""mrk"". Then, I need to go through each tweet and identify positive and negative factors. The first tweet says ""sick and tired of losing money on $ crs $ pii $ mrk $ cbm equity URL"". Hmm, it mentions losing money, but not specifically about MSFT. So maybe this is more about overall tech sentiment rather than the stock itself.

Next, the second tweet is a newsletter that gained 5,000% in 4.5 months and asks to subscribe for updates. The use of ""gained"" and ""subscribe today"" suggests excitement and interest, which could boost investor confidence. This seems like it's positive.

The third tweet says $ mrk : novartis , glaxo swap units ; lilly buying animal biz URL. It mentions purchases related to Novartis and Glaxo, but I don't have specific information about the company. Since we don't know much about Animal biz or Novartis, it's hard to assess sentiment here. Maybe there are some positive signs of growth or expansion.

Putting this together: The newsletter shows strong interest and positive trends for MSFT. Even though the first tweet isn't directly about the stock, the second one is a clear indicator of excitement. The third tweet has potential but not definitive information. So overall, the sentiment seems positive."
2014-04-24,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants me to determine their impact on a company's stock price. They've given specific steps: identify the target stock from the tweets, analyze each tweet as positive or negative factors, assess sentiment, and then summarize overall sentiment.

First, I need to figure out which stock symbol is in these tweets. Looking at the tweets, they mention ""mrk"", so I think that's Market Reactivation Corporation, known for microfinance. 

Next, each tweet includes a few words like $ mrk, mmm, pfe, xly, xlk, vlo URL. Since only ""mrk"" is relevant, those others are probably distractors or not part of the stock symbol. I'll focus on ""mrk"".

Now, for each tweet:

1. ""$ mrk getting interesting"": This suggests excitement about the company's future.
2. ""mmm"": That's a common acronym for ""Market Moving Average"" and usually indicates expected price movements in the near term.
3. ""pfe"": Probably stands for Pfeiffer Strategies, another firm mentioned in the tweets.
4. ""xly"": Xlylko? Not sure about this one; maybe it's a typo or irrelevant.
5. ""xlk"": Could be Xlylko or another unrelated stock.

Since only $ mrk is relevant, I'll consider each as separate factors. 

For sentiment analysis: The tweet mentions excitement (mrk getting interesting), which generally is positive. The expected move (mmm) suggests investors are looking ahead, so that's also positive. The inclusion of Xlylko might be a distraction or irrelevant info.

Putting it all together, the overall impact seems positive because there's significant buzz and expectation for growth."
2014-04-25,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets are going to impact the stock price for a given company. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet says $ biib here are some stocks to watch $ mrk $ hd $ rt financialnews URL. Hmm, this seems like a list or an offer related to certain stocks. I'm not sure what specific stocks these are referring to, but the fact that it mentions companies named after people or organizations might be a positive sign because it could mean more reliable information sources. So maybe this tweet is trying to encourage investors to look at those stocks.

The second tweet mentions Dow stocks and lists several companies like WMT, TRV, CAT, HD, BA, V, AXP, GS, CSCO, MRK, GE, PG, KO, JNJ, CVX, JPM, MCD, PFE, XOM, UNH. That's a pretty comprehensive list of stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Index. This could be significant because companies on the Dow are more likely to have stable prices and trends that could affect the overall market.

Now, breaking down each tweet:

First tweet: It's an offer or announcement about several companies, so it's positive as it might lead to increased interest in those stocks. But I'm not sure if it's a warning or just information.

Second tweet: A complete list of Dow Jones stocks. That's interesting because the stock market trends often reflect the overall performance of these companies. So this tweet could indicate that there's a lot of activity in the financial sector, which is usually a positive sign for the stock price.

Putting it together, both tweets are providing information about companies or sectors that could influence each other and potentially affect the stock price. They're offering relevant data points and lists important stocks. 

I think both tweets might be building up the expectation of positive market performance, especially if they provide timely and accurate information. But I'm not sure if combining them would result in a more pronounced positive effect or just confirming existing expectations.

So overall, based on these tweets, it seems like they're providing useful information to potential investors, possibly signaling a favorable outlook for the stock. Therefore, the sentiment is likely positive."
2014-04-26,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given tweets to determine their impact on a company's stock price. Let me break down what I know.

First, each tweet seems to be talking about the stock market in general or related topics. The user provided a sample tweet: ""stock market reports you need on $ t $ shw $ mrk $ amzn equity URL"". It looks like it's asking for information on the stock named MKT. 

I don't see any relevant tweets after this one, so I'm not sure how to proceed beyond just looking at the single tweet provided. The user wants me to predict the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a specific company. But since there are no other tweets, maybe I should consider that all my analysis is based on just this one tweet.

Okay, let's think about what each component would do. Extracting the stock symbol from a tweet could be tricky unless it's obvious. The tweet here seems to ask for details on the MKT stock. Maybe it's an official stock like Amazon or Microsoft? That makes sense because those are common stock symbols and companies are well-known.

Now, looking at the factors: Positive and negative. The user is asking for a stock report, so that's definitely positive. I don't see any negative words here. It might just be a standard request to get information on the stock.

Sentiment analysis: Since it's just a direct request for a stock report, there are no conflicting or contradictory comments. So, the sentiment isn't particularly biased; it's pretty straightforward.

Combining all that, I think this tweet is positive because it's asking for information on an existing stock, which is a common regulatory action. There's no negative news here to affect the stock price negatively. 

Wait, but sometimes when users ask for information, they might include something that could imply more about the company beyond just reporting stock details. But in this case, since it's a straightforward request, I don't see any hidden implications.

So, considering all factors—positive query, no conflicting information—it should be a positive impact on the stock price."
2014-04-27,Neutral,"Okay, let me figure out how to approach this problem. The user has given two tweets and wants to determine their impact on a stock's future price. They want me to analyze each tweet as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to extract the stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""2 ' - cyano substituted nucleoside derivatives and methods of use thereof for treatment of ... $ mrk c07d c07d487 URL"". The word ""mrk"" stands out as a likely company name, and after that, there's a URL with numbers. That doesn't immediately suggest an investment stock symbol because the numbers seem random and not typical for any known sector.

The second tweet: ""$ crs $ awk $ mrk $ rax equity URL"". Again, ""mrk"" is present in both tweets, which is a bit confusing. The terms ""crs"", ""awk"", ""rax"" don't ring a bell as stock symbols or meaningful keywords. The use of $ signs and URLs also doesn't give me any immediate information about the company.

Since I can't identify a clear stock symbol from either tweet, it's challenging to assess their impact on the stock price. Without knowing which company they're referring to, my analysis is incomplete. However, if both tweets are about ""mrk"", maybe I can infer some things based on the context—though without more information or additional analysis like financial statements or industry context, it's hard to evaluate the sentiment.

I think in a real-world scenario, I'd need to know which stock exactly these tweets are referring to. But since that's not provided here, my conclusion is that either both tweets are about the same but unknown stock, making it difficult to determine their impact. Therefore, I can't confidently assign them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative."
2014-04-28,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided two tweets and wants to analyze their impact on a stock's future price using a scale of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to figure out the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""updated w / remark from dekkers : merck could snag $ 14b from consumer biz as bayer , reckitt race to the wire URL mrk"". This seems to be about Merck's earnings potential, which suggests it might be the target stock.

The second tweet is more of a casual remark: ""rt AT_USER earnings expected tuesday : $ mrk $ bmy $ ebay $ esrx $ s - 5 largest u . s . companies by market cap . research them here : URL"". It mentions earnings but doesn't provide a specific stock name. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, the user might have meant to include more information in the second tweet, maybe referencing Merck or another stock mentioned elsewhere. Since I don't see it explicitly, perhaps it's not relevant, so I should focus on the first tweet which clearly mentions Merck as a potential target.

Now, for each tweet, I need to identify Positive and Negative factors. The first tweet talks about Merck potentially securing significant earnings ($14B), which is positive. It also mentions Bayer andreckitt racing towards the wire URL, which could influence market sentiment positively or negatively? Not sure yet.

The second tweet seems more like a general remark without specific info on a stock. Without a stock symbol, it's hard to assess factors or sentiment. So I should focus only on the first tweet for now since that gives a clear target.

Assessing sentiment: The tweet mentions possible earnings gains and racing companies, which are positive developments for investors. That suggests mixed sentiment—some positive (earnings) but also some positive in terms of race to market position, maybe pushing markets higher.

Putting it together: Positive factors like potential earnings and company races support a favorable overall sentiment. Therefore, the stock is likely expected to go up."
2014-04-29,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for Mrk. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. The first tweet is ""mrk : us stocks-wall st climbs , lifted by merck , sprint on rosy earnings URL"". So the stock symbol here is MRK.

Now, for each tweet, I have to look at the factors and assess the sentiment. 

The second tweet says ""$ mrk merck's spike leads the dow jones today URL"". That seems to be about the Dow Jones index moving up because of Merck's earnings. So it's related to US stocks as well.

Next, I need to assess if these tweets influence investor sentiment for MRK. Both tweets mention that stock performance might positively impact MRK because of Merck and their earnings. 

So both tweets indicate that US stocks are doing well. That would likely lead people to think that the positive news is good for their investments in MRK.

Putting it together, both tweets suggest a positive outlook on Mrk's stock, leading me to conclude that this should be a [Positive] sentiment."
2014-04-30,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. Okay, so each tweet seems to be related to a different company: BAC (Bayer), Merck, KMB, and GM. 

Starting with BAC's tweet about animal health assets and cash exchange. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with that, but it sounds like they're talking about investments or resources. Maybe this is positive because it shows interest in their operations. But wait, I should check if the information is accurate. Without more context, I can't be sure, so I'll just note it as unsure.

Next, Merck's tweet mentions how to weight dividend payers. That definitely sounds positive. Dividend-paying stocks are often seen as good investments because they provide steady income. So this one seems positively impacting.

Then, KMB's tweet is about money management, which makes sense in a financial context. It could relate to portfolio diversification or risk management, all of which can be positive for investors. I'll mark it as positive here too.

Lastly, GM's tweet talks about looking for the next $ kmb$ mrk$ ggp$ feye moneymanagement. This seems like it's trying to promote their stock directly. If this is a direct call to action or an offer, that could be very positive because it immediately shows interest and might encourage immediate trading.

Putting it all together, each tweet seems to have some positive sentiment points, except maybe BAC, which is uncertain. However, given the other three tweets are clearly positive, the overall sentiment might still lean towards positive because these trends can naturally lead to a favorable outcome."
2014-05-01,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided several tweets related to the stock price of a company, specifically mentioning $mrk. My task is to analyze these tweets and determine if they likely increase, decrease, or leave the stock underscored in terms of positive impact.

First, I need to identify each tweet individually and note any key factors like Positive or Negative elements and assess their sentiment towards investor interest.

Starting with tweet 1: ""$ unt get great research on stocks $ mrk $ cma $ vfc click URL"". The term ""click"" suggests that the user is searching for more information, so this seems positive. It might indicate they are looking ahead to upcoming content or updates about the stock.

Moving to tweet 2: ""$ mrk : reckitt benckiser says no longer in talks with merck URL"". This sentence mentions a decision-making event regarding $mrk and its collaboration with another company, reckitt benckiser. If they're saying they won't be collaborating anymore, it could imply that the relationship is ending, which might lead to a decline in stock price as investors wait for clarity on the deal.

Tweet 3: ""$ find out the latest on $ phm $ ttc $ mrk $ df worth a look URL"". Here, ""phm"" and ""tfc"" are mentioned. These abbreviations likely stand for something specific related to the company, possibly their products or operations. If they're revealing detailed information about $mrk, it could be a positive sign of clarity on the company's performance.

Tweets 4,5,6,7: All start with ""rt AT_USER can $ mrk pull rabbit from its hat next week at analyst mtg & somehow accelerate lung cancer pd - *long shot*."". These are highly similar and mention a hypothetical scenario where $mrk could pull out of an analyst's attention or complete some action that might lead to a filing. The use of ""pulled rabbit from hat"" and ""accelerate lung cancer"" suggests a negative impact, implying that the stock is seen as undervalued because investors expect the company to avoid attention to avoid financial pressure.

Analyzing each tweet: 1 is positive due to ""clicking."" 2 might be negative because it's indicating a departure from an agreement. 3 could be neutral or maybe positive if it provides detailed info, but tweets 4-7 are clearly negative with hopeful scenarios.

To sum up, most tweets point towards a negative outlook on $mrk, except tweet 1 which is slightly positive due to the click prompt."
2014-05-02,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about Merck and something else related to their stock price. The user provided a list of 10 tweets and asked me to determine whether each is positive, neutral, or negative towards the stock's impact.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. Let's see:

1. The first tweet mentions that Merck and Ecyt are testing an ovarian cancer drug called Vynfinit, which unexpectedly caused their stock price to shoot up on Twitter with a URL. That seems positive because they're taking action related to the company.

2. The second tweet talks about AT_USER trying to pull a rabbit out of someone's hat next week at an analyst meeting, and somehow accelerating lung cancer filing? It sounds like speculation or an unrelated event that might not impact stock prices much, so probably neutral.

3. This one is about the FDA voting on something related to OTC switches for Merck's Singulair, which affects adults in the pharma sector. The vote against them seems significant but not directly impacting the stock price unless there are regulatory issues or updates that could affect their operations.

4. Similar to tweet 3, this one is about AT_USER trying to pull a rabbit out of someone's hat next week at an analyst meeting and accelerating lung cancer filing? Again, this seems like a speculative story without immediate impact on stock prices.

5. This one repeats the same event as the previous three, so it should also be neutral because it's unrelated to the company's performance or operations.

6. The same pattern continues here—speculative speculation about an accident affecting something else, likely not relevant to Merck's stock price.

7. Here, the user is suggesting that someone has great research on stocks and going to a URL, which might indicate some positive information about the market but doesn't directly impact the company's stock unless it provides news or data.

8. This tweet also repeats the speculative narrative from 2-6, so again, likely neutral because there's no clear link to Merck's performance.

9. Similar to tweets 3 and 4, this is a speculative story about regulatory actions affecting pharma, so I'll consider it as neutral.

10. The same as tweet 9, speculative narrative without any connection to the stock price.

Now, compiling these thoughts: Many tweets are either speculative or unrelated, especially when they involve speculation about events unrelated to Merck's business operations or financials. Some mention regulatory actions affecting pharma, but that might be positive because it could lead to new regulations or changes in market dynamics. However, given the other tweets focusing on speculation and no concrete information, the overall sentiment seems neutral.

But wait, some tweets are clearly about Merck directly—like tweet 1 mentioning their trial of a drug which caused their stock price to go up. That's definitely positive because it shows an action from Merck that's related to their business. So I should prioritize these because they're more directly impacting the company and its stock.

Putting this together, most tweets are speculative or unrelated except for some positive ones about Merck. However, since there are also speculative stories elsewhere, it might not be a consistent trend. But maybe there's enough positivity in a couple of tweets to offset the speculative news from others. Alternatively, maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because it's too volatile without clear signals.

I think the best conclusion would be that while some tweets show positive actions related to Merck, the majority are speculative or unrelated, so the overall impact isn't strong enough to tip it definitively as positive or negative."
2014-05-03,Neutral,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets and trying to figure out their impact on the stock price of the company in question. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. The user mentioned to extract the stock symbol, but looking at the tweets provided, they don't mention a specific stock. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe each tweet is talking about the same stock? I'll proceed with the assumption that these tweets are related to the S&P 500 ETFs listed, which includes stocks like MRK ( maker ) or other companies.

Next, I have to analyze each tweet individually. All seven tweets seem similar in content: they mention AT_USER's ability to pull a rabbit from his hat next week by accelerating lung cancer filing something, with multiple 'long shot' and 'maybe' phrases. There's no explicit information about the stock symbol or what it's selling for.

Looking at each tweet (1 through 7), they all have the same message: mentioning an upcoming filing related to lung cancer in a vague, negative way. It seems like each one is offering a similar outlook that's not positive or negative. The user is speculating about the stock performance but doesn't provide any concrete information.

There are also two more tweets (8 and 9) which mention S&P100 stocks comparing their trends against other specific stocks. However, without knowing if these are related to the same company as the previous tweets, it's hard to assess the sentiment impact on that particular stock. If tweet 8 is about a comparison between SPY ($bax) and other stocks like ACN ($acn), I don't have any context linking this to the target stock from the first set of tweets.

Considering all these tweets collectively, each one is offering speculative insights into potential future trends but doesn't provide any quantifiable data or analysis. They're all negative in tone, just expressed vaguely. The user's outlook isn't strong enough to significantly impact investor sentiment towards the stock price without more information about what they believe will happen.

So, putting it all together, these tweets are providing speculative and vague insights into future events but aren't actionable for predicting stock prices. There's no clear positive or negative trend being offered here, so the overall sentiment is neutral."
2014-05-04,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out the stock's likely impact based on these tweets. The user provided four tweets about a company called MRK. I'm not too familiar with MRK, but maybe it's related to pharmaceuticals since some of them mention big pharma companies.

Looking at each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER can $ mrk pull rabbit from it's hat next week at analyst mtg & somehow accelerate lung cancer pd - 1 filing ? * long shot * …"" – Hmm, this is a lot like the previous one. It seems to be a long shot about some filing related to lung cancer. The mention of accelerating lung cancer might indicate potential health issues or problems that could affect the stock.

2. ""rt AT_USER can $ mrk pull rabbit from it's hat next week at analyst mtg & somehow accelerate lung cancer pd - 1 filing ? * long shot * …"" – Same as the first one, another attempt to pull a rabbit out of a hat with a lung cancer file. This reinforces the idea that something might go wrong related to lung cancer.

3. Another tweet saying the same thing: ""rt AT_USER can $ mrk pull rabbit from it's hat next week at analyst mtg & somehow accelerate lung cancer pd - 1 filing ? * long shot * …"" – It seems like a recurring structure here, which could suggest that the company is on track to address this issue but in an unexpected way.

4. ""get pennystock research on $ mrk $ qcom $ pcar $ isrg click URL"" – This looks like Google Scholar or ResearchGate. The query mentions multiple companies: pennystock, qcom, pcar, and isrg. If MRK is a company that's being researched or supported by others, this could mean the stock might be getting more attention or support from analysts.

5. ""$ mrk big pharma stands to profit by cleaning out its medicine chests URL"" – This tweet links MRK to profits coming from cleaning out medicine chests. If they're cleaning out medicine chests, maybe that's a way to reduce costs and increase profitability, which could be positive for the stock price.

6. ""$ mrk big pharma stands to profit by cleaning out its medicine chests URL"" – Same link as tweet 5. This reinforces the idea that profits are coming from this strategy, making it look like MRK is doing well in the industry.

7. Another mention ofcleaning out medicine chests: ""rt AT_USER can $ mrk pull rabbit from it's hat next week at analyst mtg & somehow accelerate lung cancer pd - 1 filing ? * long shot * …"" – Again, similar structure but different subject. The acceleration of a file suggests an issue is being addressed in the hope of pulling out something.

8. ""$ mrk big pharma stands to profit by cleaning out its medicine chests URL"" – Another link with the same idea as tweet 5 and 6. It seems like this could be a consistent source for profit, supporting MRK's stock.

9. ""$ mrk 1 pipeline all investors need to know URL"" – This is from Google Scholar again. If it mentions MRK being part of a pipeline that everyone needs to know, maybe the stock is being discussed or expected to increase in value as more information comes out.

Putting this together, there are elements of potential health issues (lung cancer), possible support from others, and plans for increased profits by cleaning up medicine chests. The links are consistent across multiple tweets, especially in 5,6,7,8 which talk about profits. The fact that they mention ""cleaning out medicine chests"" could be a way to cut costs or increase efficiency. The repeated calls for long shots related to lung cancer might not have a clear positive or negative impact yet but could indicate some concern.

The last tweet links MRK being part of a pipeline, which might mean more attention or investment from others. So overall, there are elements of uncertainty (lungs) and potential for increased profits, but no clear signs of strong support or growth."
2014-05-05,Missing,File not found
2014-05-06,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Merck (MRK). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, each tweet seems to be related to a meeting or financial announcement about Merck. The first 15 tweets are all about meetings in Boston and mentions of people like Joe Romanelli and other team members planning some meeting. There's also mention of the company laying out deals and possibly filing something. Then there are two more tweets (16-17) that talk about a $14 billion deal to sell consumer-products unit to Bayer. The next few tweets (18-20) discuss Merck focusing on their business model, selling a consumer unit to Bayer.

Looking at the first 15 tweets, they all seem like positive signs or calls for action, maybe indicating that the company is investing in other areas. The mentions of meetings and people planning are usually good indicators that things are positive because investors likely see potential growth opportunities. 

Then, tweet 16 clearly states a $14 billion deal to sell its consumer-products unit to Bayer. This is a significant announcement and could have a material impact on the company's finances. If they're selling their consumer business, it might either improve or hurt their profitability depending on where they're selling it.

The following tweets (17-20) talk about Merck focusing on their business model, which suggests that the previous deal is expected to go through, leading to a more stable financial position. This could be a positive signal because stability in key areas can boost investor confidence and stock price.

Putting this all together: The initial 15 tweets show that there are plans, meetings, and potential deals. The big announcement in tweet 16 about the $14 billion sale is a concrete event that could have material effects on their performance. The subsequent focus tweets indicate they're taking the next step, which is positive. Therefore, these trends seem to be a mix of optimism but also some cautious steps. However, given that the deal is significant and upcoming, it might signal better-than-expected results, leading to a positive impact."
2014-05-07,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out the likely impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company based on the given data. First, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. **Considering investing in mrk**: This seems straightforward—it's just looking ahead and deciding to invest. It’s a positive action but doesn't provide specific information about the market or factors affecting it.
   
2. ** analyst downgrades groupon inc., merck & co, etc. and ysl inc.** This clearly mentions that the company is being downgraded by analysts. Downgrades usually indicate a negative sentiment, suggesting a potential decline in stock price.

3. **rt AT_USER so far nothing all that unexpected at mrk analyst mtg except maybe they are filing odana despite numerical imbalance ...**: This is a repeating tweet but again, mentions that the company is being downgraded and also mentions some unexpected action regarding filing something. The mention of an analyst downgrade likely has a strong negative impact.

4. **rt AT_USER big thank u from joe romanelli and the other great mrk ir team members ( carol & justin ) for planning today's mtg . loo ...**: This seems like a casual message expressing gratitude, possibly indicating that they're planning something together. Doesn't have immediate market implications.

5. **Similar to tweet 3, same text with same actions. So it’s consistent with the analyst downgrade and unexpected action mentioned earlier.**

6. **mrk hepatitis c and merck [merck & co., inc., gilead sciences, inc.] URL**: The company is listed as having partnerships or other companies that could impact their stock price, but there's no direct information on market movements.

7. Another repeat of tweet 3: same actions as before—downgrade by analyst and mentions an unexpected action. 

8. **mrk hepatitis c and merck [merck & co., inc., gilead sciences, inc.] URL**: Again, listing partnerships or other companies without specific sentiment cues. 

9-20: Similar structure to tweet 3, same actions of downgrading and unexpected activity by analysts.

11-14: Same as tweet 3, multiple repeats. 

15-17: More repeats of the same negative action—analyist downgrade and mentioning an unexpected activity.

18:mrk merck : new drugs pending approval or in late tests URL: This could mean that there's potential for new products to impact the stock price positively if approved. It introduces uncertainty but doesn't specify a trend yet.

20-30: Another set of downgrades and mentions a big deal meeting, which might hint at more actions to come. The mention of a $14 billion deal with BAYN further underscores potential growth or positive developments.

Now, considering all these tweets, the main points are that the company is being downgraded by analysts multiple times (tweets 2-3, 6-7, etc.), and each time they also mention something unexpected about filing an action despite numerical imbalance. This suggests a downward trend in investor sentiment.

Additionally, some tweets like 18 and 20-30 mention new drugs or deals, which could potentially boost the stock price positively. However, these are more speculative and not as directly backed by information from the other tweets. 

Overall, while there's some speculative positive news about new developments, the majority of the tweets are heavily downplaying that with consistent negative actions. The main sentiment is a mix of uncertainty and potential negative factors like analyst downgrades.

So, considering all these elements—positive mentions of deals but more negative actions from analysts—it seems likely that the stock price could decline in the short term due to these negative trends."
2014-05-08,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price impact on MrK. 

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through the tweets, I see several mentions like ""mrk"" or other variations such as "" stocks"" and ""url"". It seems like ""mrk"" is a common abbreviation for ""Mr. K"", so that's probably the stock symbol we're focusing on.

Now, looking at each tweet individually:

1. ""rt AT_USER so far nothing all that unexpected at $ mrk analyst mtg . except maybe they are filing odana despite numerical imbalance …"" - I don't see any positive or negative sentiment here.
2. ""mrk - what should merck do with its $ 14 billion windfall ? -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" - This one seems neutral because it's providing a question and offers a URL, which could be a link for more information. It doesn't express a strong opinion on the stock.
3. Similar to tweet 1, this is about the analyst comments and filing, so no sentiment here.
4. Another question from ""AT_USER"", offering another URL without any positive or negative language.
5. This tweet asks about selling certain stocks and money, which seems like a sell-side commentary but doesn't express strong support for the stock.
6. Same as tweets 1-3, it's just repeating information and asking about the stock via a URL, so neutral sentiment.
7. Again, same pattern, offering more details on the analyst comments without any positive language.

Putting it all together, each tweet is either providing info or asking about future actions related to selling stocks. There are no clear positives or negatives here. The overall sentiment seems Neutral because everything is just informing or prompting action without expressing a strong opinion."

2014-05-12,Neutral,"Alright, let me figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on the stock price for the given company.

First, looking at tweet 1: The user is announcing an HBN program from Hamilton BioChemical. I'm not entirely sure what that stands for, but the link seems to be pointing somewhere related to biotech or pharmaceuticals. If this is a positive development, especially in the health or biotechnology sector, it could boost investor confidence and potentially increase stock value.

Now, tweet 2 mentions that the CEO of $mrk drug ceos isn't ready to leave the US yet as rivals like USRF and TKM R have fled the URL. This sounds concerning because if a key executive is being held back by competitors, it could indicate a strategic move to maintain control. That might lead investors to expect more stability in their operations, which could be a positive sign for stock price.

Putting it together, both tweets present positive scenarios. The first tweet is exciting and possibly a good signal. The second tweet is negative but balanced because it reflects concerns about key figures being held back by rivals. This suggests the company might face internal competition without external changes. However, if the CEO's actions are indicative of long-term plans that align with future needs or innovations, the negative factor could be offset.

Considering all this, the overall sentiment seems mixed but leans towards a positive outlook because while there is some concern, it might signal the company is on the right track and can weather some volatility. I'm leaning towards a Neutral stance."
2014-05-13,Missing,File not found
2014-05-14,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price for MrK. Let me break it down.

First tweet says options iv is too low and mentions their presence at ASCO setting up a sneaky 3-digit percentage increase on calls. That sounds positive because it's about improving or increasing something, which can be seen as an upward trend. Also, mentioning that their data is there for a potential sneaky gain could encourage investors to stay cautious or play games, but the main takeaway here is that options are low and they're looking for gains.

Second tweet is more of a casual chat with a 14-year-old asking for meds. It seems like a joke or just trying to lighten the mood. No positive information about the stock here, so it's probably not affecting investor sentiment much.

So combining both, the first tweet leans towards positive factors but might have some negative aspects based on the potential gain. The overall sentiment is mixed, maybe leaning towards neutral because while there are positive points about options and setup plans, the casual chat isn't providing clear info."
2014-05-15,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price for Merck. Let me break down each tweet step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""mrk : merck kgaa sees profit rising on az electronic purchase URL."" The word 'profit' in their name gives an immediate positive vibe. They're talking about seeing profits, which is a strong indicator of good news for investors. So that's definitely a positive sign.

Next, tweet 2: ""$ mrk merck daily : 1.11 % weekly : 0.95 % ytd : 13.51 % trend : 50 / 100."" The numbers here show increasing percentages over time, which is good because it means their performance is improving. The trend at 50/100 could indicate a growing momentum or favorable data. So, this also adds to the positive sentiment.

Now, tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER $ bmy $ mrk $ azn bring new checkpoint inhibitor data to asco 14 — > URL."" This one is less clear at first glance. 'Bmy' and 'azn' are not familiar terms that I recognize in Merck's context. The mention of a checkpoint inhibitor suggests they might be looking for specific research or news. But it doesn't directly state anything positive about the stock price. It could either support them if they're a tech company, but since it seems speculative, it might have mixed feelings.

So, considering all three tweets: two are clearly positive with strong financial terms and increasing trends, and one is ambiguous but possibly neutral or even negative if I don't recognize 'bmy' as Merck. But given the context of ' checkpoint inhibitor data', which could be a strategic move for Merck's stock, maybe there's some positive implication, though it might not be enough to outweigh the other two tweets.

Putting all this together, two out of three tweets are strong indicators of positive sentiment. The third one is borderline but leaning towards potential support. Still, considering the clarity and directness of the first two, I think they should have a more significant impact on the stock price."

2014-05-17,Neutral,"Alright, let me tackle this query step by step. The user has provided three tweets and is asking to determine their likely impact on a company's stock price using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to figure out the target stock from the tweets. Looking at each tweet, they all seem to reference ""phm"", ""mrk"", ""arns"", etc., which are names of companies. Without more context, it's a bit tricky, but maybe each number refers to different stocks? Like perhaps tweet 1 is about PHM, tweet 2 about MRK, and tweet 3 about ANRS or something else. 

Next, the user mentioned a process: identify the stock symbol, analyze each tweet as Positive, Negative, or Neutral factors. But since I can't know which symbols are being referenced, maybe I should consider it abstractly. Perhaps the goal is to assess trends across related stocks.

Looking at the tweets, they all mention URLs with words like ""must have URL,"" ""url now URL,"" etc., suggesting these could be domains for services or links to URLs on a website that might provide stock information or analysis. But without knowing what those URLs point to, it's hard to assess sentiment directly.

Assuming each tweet is about different stocks, maybe they're indicating a lack of interest in certain companies or suggesting to avoid them. The user could be advising investors to keep an eye on specific sectors or perhaps caution against certain investments due to perceived issues or instability.

However, without concrete information about the stocks or any relevant data points, it's challenging to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Each tweet seems more like a warning or suggestion rather than a clear indicator of market performance. 

Given that I don't have enough context to evaluate each tweet's impact on stock prices, I might need to make an educated guess based on common practices in analysis. If multiple tweets are pointing in the same direction without any contradictory information, maybe it leans towards [Neutral]. But this is speculative since each tweet could be a different angle.

I should probably stick to my initial thought of [Neutral] as there's no clear positive or negative indication from these tweets."

2014-05-19,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for Merck & Company. 

First, I see that each tweet is a separate piece of information. The first tweet mentions ""stock_tracker,"" ""dd board,"" ""mrk"" (Merck), and some specific stock data. It also includes a URL related to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 

I need to break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the Target Stock**: From the tweet, I can extract the stock symbol which is ""mrk"". That's Merck & Company.

2. **Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis**:
   - The first tweet seems like it might be providing information about stock tracking or board details but lacks a specific target stock.
   
3. **Separate Factors**: Looking at each relevant tweet, I can identify positive and negative factors:
   - Positive: ""mrk"" being mentioned multiple times to indicate attention to Merck's stock.
   - Negative: The URL pointing to the Dow Jones Industrial Average might be related to market news but isn't directly a factor affecting Merck's stock.

4. **Assess Sentiment**: While the tweet mentions Merck and its stock symbol, it doesn't provide enough information about sentiment towards the stock itself or any specific factors that could influence investor reactions.

Since the tweet is just informing about merk without providing in-depth analysis on the stock performance or market sentiment related to Merck, I can't make a detailed assessment. It's minimal information and not structured for evaluating investment trends or potential impacts on the stock price."
2014-05-20,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze some tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at both tweets, neither mentions a specific stock, so that might complicate things. Hmm, maybe it's not important for this analysis since each tweet is about different sectors—real estate and financial services.

Next, I have to break down each tweet into Positive and Negative factors. For the first tweet, $ an get great research on stocks $ mrk $ aet $ live give it a try URL. The terms like ""get great research,"" ""invest,"" and ""url"" suggest investment ideas or suggestions but don't directly mention any financial performance metrics. So, this might be a positive factor as it could attract investors looking for alternatives.

The second tweet mentions ""stock watchlist you should be looking at $ gt $ tol $ mrk $ ir moneymanagement URL."" Again, ""money management"" and ""watchlist"" are keywords here, which could influence investor sentiment positively. People might feel more confident in their financial decisions if they're on a watchlist.

Both tweets are encouraging investors without providing concrete data or results. They’re more about offering something to look forward to rather than predicting specific outcomes. Therefore, each tweet is positive because it's engaging and provides value, which can attract attention and increase sentiment positively."

2014-05-22,Negative,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets and trying to figure out their impact on the stock price. First, let me break down each tweet.

The first tweet says ""$ mrk - stocks rise ; URL climbs in market debut -> URL stock action"". Hmm, ""stocks rise"" sounds positive, so that's a good sign. The term ""URL climbed in market debut"" might be tricky, but if it means the stock did well or reached a high point, that would definitely boost investor confidence.

The second tweet is just ""mrk"". Without more context, this seems too vague to assess sentiment directly. It could be positive or negative without more details.

I don't have information about the company MRK, so I can't evaluate it beyond what's in each tweet. The first tweet adds a significant positive note with ""stocks rise,"" but the second is unclear. 

So overall, there's some positive indication from the first tweet, but the second is too ambiguous to make a clear assessment."

2014-05-24,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the given tweet about the penny stock and determine its impact on the company's future stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, identifying the target stock symbol from the tweet seems straightforward. The user mentions ""mrk"" which stands for Microsoft, so that's our target stock: Microsoft (MSFT).

Next, I'll perform a tweet-by-tweet analysis. Each relevant tweet needs to be divided into positive and negative factors. Let me check the provided tweet:

The tweet says, ""subscribers saw our penny stock alerts gain over 4,000 % this year ! subscribe today : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd""

Wait, that doesn't seem right. The user mentions ""subscribers saw..."" but then there are symbols like $ mrk and $ lgnd. I think there's a typo here because $ lgnd isn't a standard symbol for any major stock. Maybe it was meant to be ""lgnd"" or another correct symbol? Or perhaps it's a placeholder.

Assuming the intention is to mention Microsoft (MSFT), then the part about subscribers seeing alerts gaining 4,000% seems positive because that indicates good news for investors. The user also says they're URLing stocks and mentions $ lgnd, but I can't make sense of that. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be ""urling"" or another word.

In the tweet, the main message is about penny stocks doing well. So, the positive factor here is that subscribers are seeing gains, which probably means investors are excited and buying more shares. The negative factors might be if there were any issues mentioned, but from what's provided, it doesn't seem like there are any negatives.

So, overall, the tweet is mainly positive with a strong emphasis on subscriber interest in penny stocks. But since there's confusion about $ lgnd, I should address that as well to avoid misinterpreting the message.

Putting it all together: The tweet highlights good news for subscribers regarding a rise in penny stock prices by 4000%, which is very positive. There might be some minor issues or typos, but the primary sentiment is positive. Therefore, the overall impact on future stock price seems to be favorable."
2014-05-25,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided two specific tweets and wants me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their expected effect on the stock.

First, let's look at the first tweet: ""$ mrk : is merck poised to head higher ? URL"". Here, ""mrk"" likely stands for Merck, a major pharmaceutical company. The phrase ""poeded to head higher?"" seems like a casual question or statement about their future performance. It doesn't specify any positive or negative information but rather expresses a question. In stock market terms, such statements are generally neutral because they're not providing concrete data or analysis but just an observation.

Now, the second tweet is ""$ pharma biotech hcl $ mrk $ nvs $ gsk $ pf $ lly india-based hcl technologies $ 500 million deal it inked with merck … URL"". This seems to mention that HCL Technologies made a significant 500 million dollar deal with Merck. The word ""hence"" at the end is interesting because it suggests a logical conclusion or result from the previous tweet. If the first tweet was neutral and the second mentions an explicit deal amount, this could indicate a positive trend in their financials. However, I need to consider that such transactions can sometimes be speculative or based on speculation rather than actual performance. While the impact of a 500 million deal is significant, it's still more about the company's actions and revenue than its future stock price directly.

Putting this together: The first tweet doesn't provide enough data or analysis but is neutral in tone. The second tweet does mention a specific deal amount with Merck, which could positively influence investor expectations, making the overall sentiment positive."

2014-05-28,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the company mentioned. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll identify each tweet and extract the relevant information. 

1. The first tweet says ""rt AT_USER premier biomedical advances new cancer treatment methodology protocol .. URL $ mrk biotech stocks."" So, the main point here is that AT_USER has developed a new cancer treatment in biotech, which is part of the MRK stock. This seems positive because it's introducing a breakthrough product and aligning with their business goals.

2. The second tweet mentions trying to make money on $ awi $ sdrl $ mrk $ s, but I don't see any information about the company or products mentioned here. It just talks about trying to make money, which might be neutral because it's speculative without concrete info.

3. The third tweet says ""find more winners like $ tex $ tpx $ mrk $ fb financial URL."" Again, similar structure as the second tweet. It's suggesting trying new strategies or products but doesn't provide specific information about the company's progress or financial performance. This could be considered neutral because it's just a suggestion without concrete data.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. Positive: The introduction of a cancer treatment product is strong news that can boost stock price.
2. Neutral: Speculative speculative investment advice without actual data; might not have significant impact yet.
3. Neutral: Suggesting new strategies but no specific info on the company or its performance.

Putting it all together, the first tweet gives a positive signal with a breakthrough product. The others are either speculation (neutral) or lack concrete information (neutral). So overall sentiment is Positive because of the successful launch."
2014-05-29,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock for impact on its future price. So, the task is to look at each tweet and decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative regarding the stock's performance.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk : premier biomedical advances new cancer treatment methodology protocol URL"". Hmm, this seems like a link extraction thing. The company is called ""mrk"" which might be an acronym or initials. I'm not sure about their exact product name. It says they've advanced a new cancer treatment method through a protocol from biomedical. That sounds like innovation and advancement in the field of cancer treatments. So, positive because it's talking about progress and innovation.

Moving to the second tweet: ""$ mrk : latest breakthrough in gene therapy protocol URL"". Again, using $ mrk, I'm thinking this is referring to their latest achievement in gene therapy. The word ""breakthrough"" suggests a significant improvement or discovery, which would be positive for investors as it indicates potential growth.

Now, considering the context of stock analysis, each tweet could potentially influence investor sentiment positively by signaling advancements in their product line, collaborations with other industries (biomedical and gene therapy seem like big sectors), or even strategic partnerships. These positives can boost confidence in the company's future performance.

Putting this together, both tweets are positive because they highlight specific, significant advances in their business areas that could be seen as an indication of future growth potential. So, overall sentiment should be positive."
2014-05-30,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. First, I need to identify which stock symbol is being referred to here. Looking at the tweets, they all mention symbols like s&p500, biib, pxd, mck, trip, ne, dgx, etc., but without a specific stock name given, it's a bit tricky. Maybe each tweet corresponds to a different company? Or perhaps it's a typo and they're just using random abbreviations or symbols. 

Wait, the user mentioned extracting the target stock symbol, so maybe I should look for any single stock listed in these tweets. Scanning through, there are mentions of companies like biib, pxd, mck, trip, ne, dgx, tso, cah, sjm, dhi, mrk, lh, nfx, avp, mar, rai, esv, crm. Since each tweet is a separate factor influencing investor sentiment towards these stocks, I need to analyze the collective effect.

But without knowing which specific stock is being referred to in each tweet, it's hard to pinpoint the impact. It could be any one of these companies. However, perhaps there are typos or multiple tweets for different stocks. Without more context, it's ambiguous how each tweet affects a particular stock. 

Alternatively, maybe all these tweets are about the same company, just using varying abbreviations. If that's the case, I would need to look at each abbreviation and see their impact on that specific stock. For example, biib could be Biib Real Estate, pxd might be PXC, etc., but without knowing which one it is, I can't assess their impact accurately.

Assuming each tweet refers to a different stock, the overall sentiment would depend on how each of these tweets affects their respective stocks individually. However, since the user didn't specify which company they're referring to, it's difficult to give an accurate assessment. 

Perhaps the user intended for each tweet to relate to a specific company but used different symbols instead. Without knowing that detail, I can't proceed further. In such cases, it's best to assume that multiple tweets are related to the same stock or companies and provide an overall analysis based on the collective sentiment.

Given that, maybe all these tweets collectively suggest positive trends in certain sectors or companies within those periods. If they mention growth prospects, new developments, etc., they might be contributing to a positive outlook. But since each tweet is separate, I need to consider their individual factors.

Another angle: sometimes stock prices are influenced by broader market trends rather than specific company details. But the tweets also mention events like ""mrk,"" which could relate to technology companies; ""crm"" might be a financial services symbol; ""esv"" could be emerging markets; etc. These seem more speculative, suggesting that the impact isn't necessarily tied to major sectors but rather individual performance.

In conclusion, without knowing the specific stock or identifying each tweet's context, I can't determine a single overall sentiment. However, if these tweets collectively indicate positive trends and expectations about future performance in various areas, maybe the stock could be seen as having positive potential."

2014-06-02,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet mentions ovarian, h&n, and bladder with BMY, Merck, and Roche. It talks about blood tumors in 2014. Tumors can sometimes lead to cancer treatments and health benefits, but without specific information on the stock performance or market reactions, it's hard to assess the immediate impact.

The second tweet focuses on Merck's immune system-booster being effective against skin and lung cancer. If the company is a major player in immunotherapy, this could positively influence their stock price by showcasing strong performance and innovation.

The third tweet is about Merck launching new software and device for multiple sclerosis. If Merck has a market presence in that sector, especially after being mentioned in financial contexts like stocks and actions, it might boost their overall earnings and stock value.

So, putting this together: the first tweet shows some health-related developments but not specific to the company. The second emphasizes Merck's effectiveness which is positive if they're a major player. The third adds another point of success in a different sector. Combined, these all suggest good news for the stock."
2014-06-03,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine if the given tweet has a positive, neutral, or negative impact on a company's stock price. Let me start by breaking down what the user is asking for.

First, the user provided a tweet: ""$ mrk - statement of changes in beneficial ownership ( 4 ) URL"". I need to analyze this step by step based on the given instructions. 

The task involves identifying the target stock symbol, analyzing each relevant tweet's factors and sentiment, then summarizing the overall impact. The output should be one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

Starting with identifying the stock symbol. The tweet mentions ""mrk"", which I recognize as a common symbol for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT). So, the target stock is Microsoft.

Next, I need to look at each relevant tweet. Here, there's only one tweet: ""$ mrk - statement of changes in beneficial ownership ( 4 ) URL"". I should separate positive and negative factors from this single tweet. 

Positive factors might include any mention of improvements or developments related to the stock. The word ""beneficial ownership"" is a term that could indicate strategic gains, which can positively impact a company's stock value. However, without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a strong positive factor.

Negative factors would typically involve issues like negative news affecting profits, revenue, or financial performance. The absence of any negative terms here makes me think there are no significant negative factors impacting the stock.

Now, assessing sentiment. Since there are no explicit negative statements and only mentions of beneficial changes without questioning or concerns about negative aspects, it's likely that the sentiment is neutral. The focus seems on positive developments rather than any potential negative impact.

Combining these analyses: Only positive factors (beneficial ownership) but with no significant negative ones. That makes me think there's no strong indication of either a positive or negative overall impact on the stock price. Therefore, it should be considered a Neutral sentiment.

I need to make sure I cover all steps correctly and don't miss anything important. The user provided an example output which was [Neutral], so I'm confident in that conclusion."
2014-06-04,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user has given me three tweets and wants an analysis using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""sanofi , merck et glaxo envisagent de céder des traitements anciens - sources URL $ bmy $ mrk $ gsk""

Hmm, this seems like a marketing pitch. The words ""ceider"" might be a typo for ""cerberus,"" and they're offering to cancel previous treatments from companies like Sanofi, Merck, and Glaxo. They've also mentioned sources and company stock prices, which is common in financial statements or regulatory filings. Companies often release such information as part of their annual reports or to update investor expectations. This could be seen as a positive signal for investors looking ahead, giving them hope that the company might perform better. So I'd lean towards ""[Positive]"".

Second tweet: ""l'augmentation des Investissements en biologique et en médecineALE est affectée par le risque des marchés de l'économie.""

Okay, this one mentions a potential increase in investments into biologics and medicine ALE. The word ""rize"" should probably be ""risque."" So there's a concern about economic risks affecting their investment strategy. Investors are more cautious now due to economic uncertainty, so seeing a negative risk could deter them from capitalizing on the increased investment. This is likely going to have an impact on stock price. But it might not be as strong as the first tweet since it's a broader concern and not directly about performance or positive news.

Third tweet: ""l'augmentation des investissements en biologiques et en médecineALE est affectée par le risque des marchés de l'économie.""

This looks similar to the second tweet. Again, mentioning economic risks affecting investments in biologics and medicine ALE. It's another negative factor pointing towards potential uncertainty but again, broader than the first tweet.

Putting it all together, the first tweet is a positive signal about strategic changes, while the other two are more about economic risks. However, since the first tweet provides concrete information like sources and stock prices, it might have a stronger positive impact on the stock price compared to the others which are concerns rather than guarantees of future gains."
2014-06-05,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided some tweets and wants me to determine their impact on a company's stock price by classifying them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. They've given a set of steps to follow, so I need to break it down.

First, the target stock symbol is extracted from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""what did the markets get wrong ? $ bmy $ mrk $ rnnby AT_USER"". Hmm, that's a bit unclear. It seems like there are multiple prices mentioned: $bmy, $mrk, and $rnnby. I wonder if these are stock ticker symbols of specific companies or something else. Since it's not clear, maybe the target stock is one of these? Or perhaps it's an identifier for the market? I'll note that and see how to handle it.

Next, each tweet needs to be analyzed as Positive, Negative, or Neutral factors. For each tweet, I should separate into positive and negative factors. But since all tweets only have three $ symbols followed by AT_USER, this might indicate a typo. Maybe the intended sentiment is more about whether the user thinks something wrong happened, implying potential investors may buy stocks.

Assessing sentiment for each relevant tweet is tricky here because they don't specify what's going on with the stock or the market. All tweets are questioning past events and mentioning possible future actions, like suggesting the stock is undervalued. This suggests uncertainty about the company's performance, which could lead to mixed sentiment. However, since it's vague, I might lean towards a Neutral stance because without specific information, investors can't form strong opinions.

For the overall summary, combining all factors from each tweet would still leave some uncertainty, so [Neutral] seems appropriate as there's no clear direction or lack of positive indicators."

2014-06-07,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for the impact on a stock's future price.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The first tweet says ""$ sats are you looking for winners like $ mrk $ joy $ fb overvalued URL"". Hmm, that doesn't seem to specify which stock. Maybe it's referring to Sats or another tech-related company? Or perhaps it's a typo and they meant ""Mrk"" as in Microsoft? I'll assume it might be Microsoft because of the mention of 'mrk' and the word 'excel'.

Next, I'll look at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet mentions ""overvalued URL."" That sounds like a technical term or possibly related to something like an MVP (minimum viable product) or a beta. If a stock is overvalued, it might be selling off its shares because investors are expecting lower returns than the market or seeing too many price increases without merit.

Then there's ""fb"" in the tweet. I'm not sure what FB stands for here—maybe a typo or something else entirely. It could be referring to Facebook, but that seems too speculative. Alternatively, it might be a play on words with something else, like maybe they meant ""Fb,"" which isn't a stock name.

Lastly, the tweet is about looking for winners, which suggests potential upcoming trades or trends where the stock might rise. But since I don't know the exact context or what's being referred to by 'winners', it's hard to assess sentiment.

Putting this together, the first tweet seems to be negative because of the ""overvalued URL."" The second tweet is unclear and possibly speculative, which makes it difficult to gauge sentiment. The third tweet talks about potential winners but lacks context, so I can't determine much from that.

So, combining these, the overall sentiment might lean towards a Negative impact because one tweet clearly mentions overvaluation, even if others are unclear."

2014-06-09,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets about $MRK's acquisition of IDIX. So first, let me break down what each tweet is saying.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions $MRK announcements regarding the purchase of IDIX. That seems like a positive signal because they're taking action now. It looks promising for investors.

Tweet 2 says that ROGER PERLMUTTER from IDIX isn't just a dummy but makes sense in the market. This is also positive, showing that the team is making strategic moves and possibly profitable.

Tweets 3 and 4 are similar, with $MRK offering to buy IDIX for around $3.85 billion. Both look like solid offers, which should boost investor confidence. Plus, they have a link on Twitter, which might indicate credibility.

Tweet 5 talks about GILEAD's performance but doesn't affect $MRK directly. It mentions the deal but doesn't provide any immediate information about $MRK, so maybe it's more speculative or just additional info that isn't relevant here.

Tweets 6 and 7 mention a specific video link related to the $3.9 billion purchase. This gives more direct evidence of the acquisition, which is likely a key point for analysis.

Lastly, tweet 8 talks about the stocks extending gains slightly. While this might have been news before $MRK's announcement, it's also positive because extended gains can encourage investors to buy now.

Putting this all together, each tweet presents $MRK as making an offer or indicating their interest in IDIX. Positive signs like offers and mentions of successful deals suggest that the overall sentiment is positive for the stock."
2014-06-10,Negative,"Alright, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Markups Inc. The user has given me six tweets, and I have to analyze them step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Let's see:

1. ""nomura says $ mrk ... hcv market worth north of $600bn ..."" So, the stock is MRK.
2. ""achillion gets good news on the hepatitis c front : URL..."" Again, MRK.
3. ""miss it ? am anticipation 06/10 futures dip despite strong chinese data , jobs data awaits $ djia $ mrk $ tsn URL..."" MRK again.
4. ""$ mrk why gilead sciences , inc . ( gild ) lost its ground after merck & co . , inc . ( mrk ...$ GILD..."" So, GILD is mentioned multiple times, but it's not the target stock here.
5. ""$ mrk gilead faces stronger hepatitis c rival after merck deal URL..."" MRK again.
6. ""$ mrk $ idix URL..."" IDIX, which I'm less familiar with, maybe another company, so probably not the target.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let's go through them one by one.

1. ""nomura says $ mrk ... hcv market worth north of $600bn ..."" This seems like a news about the market's valuation, which could influence investor sentiment positively if investors expect better growth or value. So this is likely a positive factor.
2. ""achillion gets good news on the hepatitis c front : URL..."" Good news for biotechs, so this adds to the company's positive outlook and could boost investor confidence.
3. ""miss it ? am anticipation 06/10 futures dip despite strong chinese data , jobs data awaits $ djia $ mrk $ tsn URL..."" Despite some positive data, there seems to be a dip in futures prices, which might worry investors, leading to potential negative sentiment.
4. ""$ mrk why gilead sciences , inc . ( gild ) lost its ground after merck & co . , inc . ( mrk ...$ GILD..."" This suggests that MRK is losing ground to another company, GILD, so this could be a positive or neutral factor depending on market relations.
5. ""$ mrk gilead faces stronger hepatitis c rival after merck deal URL..."" Similar to tweet 1 and 3, mentions hepatitis C data leading to a deal, which might indicate improved market conditions for MRK.
6. ""$ mrk $ idix URL..."" Again, IDIX isn't the target stock, so this is probably not relevant here.

Next, I need to assess each tweet's sentiment towards the overall company. 

- Tweet 1: Positive about market valuation.
- Tweet 2: Positive note for biotechs.
- Tweet 3: Dipping futures prices despite positive data, which might be negative.
- Tweet 4: MRK losing ground to GILD; could be seen as positive if GILD is a competitor or has favorable terms, but could also imply a strategic move by the company itself.
- Tweets 5 and 6 are about unrelated stocks.

Now, I need to combine these sentiments. Positive tweets from 1, 2, and 3 all support MRK's position. Tweet 4 adds more positive factors if GILD is supportive. However, tweet 3 shows concern over futures prices despite positive data, which might be a red flag for the stock price.

Considering all factors, some are positive but one is uncertain due to the futures dip. The overall sentiment leans slightly negative because of the potential futures price issue, even though other tweets suggestMRK is doing well elsewhere."
2014-06-11,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol isn't provided here. Hmm, maybe that's included in the context where these tweets were generated? The user mentioned something about AT_USER from Lee & Ross and mentions MrK as an example. So, I think the target stock is probably AT_USER, which is a tech company based in Toronto.

Now, analyzing each tweet:

1. "" $ cnat i don't know maybe because of the deal with $ mrk $ idix and $ achn move or some bullish data or ?"" This seems to mention MrK (MrK), the IDIX, and ACHN stocks, which I believe are part of the MROA index. The user is unsure about the factors involved but mentions bullish data and potential moves from the deal. The use of $ cnat isn't related to stock prices, so maybe it's just filler. I'm not sure if this adds any significant positive or negative information.

2. "" rt AT_USER bruce campbell from campbell , lee & ross - past picks from 060/11 / 13 - $ mrk.ca ( +28.38 % ) , $ bns.ca ( +29.34 % ) , & $ enb.ca ( + 18 . …"" This tweet seems to be from AT_USER and mentions past picks from Lee & Ross, specifically mentioning MrK's stock performance with a positive percentage increase. It also brings up BNS and ENB stocks. The percentages are all positive, indicating a bullish outlook. However, without knowing the broader market context or company performance, it's hard to say if these moves will affect AT_USER.

3. "" rt AT_USER dow component merck ( mrk ) to go ex-dividend tomorrow .. URL $ mrk biotech stocks"" This tweet indicates that the Dow component Merck is about to go ex-dividend tomorrow and will be going to biotech stocks, which includes MROA again. Since Merck is a biotech stock, this could positively influence AT_USER if the company is in biotechnology or related sectors. The mention of ex-dividend can sometimes signal better financials as companies might distribute profits.

Putting it all together, there are two positive factors from Lee & Ross and mentions of MROA and Merck. However, without context on how these perform against other stocks or the overall market trend, I'm not certain if these will significantly affect AT_USER's stock price. But considering that past picks were positive for MrK, it might be a sign of good management or favorable news, which could contribute to a positive impact."
2014-06-12,Missing,File not found
2014-06-13,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Merck and their impact on stock price. So, the user gave me four tweets for Merck. I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I can start by breaking it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the first tweet: $ mrk : merck & co . inc . ( nyse : mrk ). So the symbol is MRK, which I know stands for Merck & Co. Inc., and it's listed on the New York Stock Exchange as MRK.

Now, I have to analyze each tweet individually. Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet says: ""$ mrk : merck & co . inc . ( nyse : mrk ) open to buying big acquisitions URL"". Hmm, this seems like a call to action. It's talking about the stock MRK opening up to buy big acquisitions and then linked to a URL. Since it's a request for an action, maybe the market is excited about acquiring larger companies. That could be positive because acquisition deals often boost stock prices.

2. The second tweet: ""mrk : merck & co . inc . ( nyse : mrk ) opening up to buy big acquisitions url"". This seems similar to the first one but with a different URL ending. It's still about buying big acquisitions and seeking action on the stock. Again, this is a call to take an action, which might push the stock higher.

3. The third tweet: ""mrk : merck & co . inc . ( nyse : mrk ) opening up to buy big acquisitions url"". Wait, this one uses the same URL as the second one. So maybe it's providing more information or a different angle? It still sounds like an action request. More actions in tech might indicate buyer interest and could boost stock price positively.

4. The fourth tweet: ""mrk : merck & co . inc . ( nyse : mrk ) opening up to buy big acquisitions url"". Similar to the previous three, this one is again requesting action on buying big acquisitions. It seems repetitive but consistent with the theme of acquiring big companies. More activity in tech stocks usually goes well for investors.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's impact. The first tweet mentions ""opening up to buy big acquisitions."" That could mean investors are interested in acquiring other companies that Merck is planning to invest in. Typically, such news can attract more buyers and increase demand, which should positively affect the stock price.

The second tweet is also about buying big acquisitions but uses a slightly different URL. It's likely following up or providing more details on their plan. More information might lead to increased interest and better investor sentiment.

The third tweet repeats the same action request. Consistency in such a way can reinforce the idea that investors want to buy, which should boost the stock price.

The fourth tweet is identical again, reiterating the acquisition plan. It's consistent across multiple tweets, indicating a steady push towards buying big companies. This consistency suggests that there's a good amount of interest and activity related to Merck's acquisitions, which can lead to positive sentiment for the stock.

I don't see any negative or neutral indicators here. All the tweets are focused on positive actions like buying big acquisitions, which is a common strategy in tech stocks. Investors often buy more shares when they receive information about expanding their operations into new markets, acquiring large companies, or entering new industries.

Therefore, considering all these factors—consistent action requests, increased interest, and a focus on acquisitions—it seems like the overall sentiment for the stock price should be positive."
2014-06-14,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has given me a query where they want me to analyze some tweets to determine their impact on a stock's future price. They also provided an example output, which I can use as a guide.

First, I need to understand the task thoroughly. The goal is to analyze each tweet to see if it contributes positively or negatively to the stock. Each tweet can have multiple factors, so I should separate positive and negative ones for each. Then, evaluate how each factor affects sentiment. Finally, combine all these assessments to determine the overall sentiment.

Looking at the example they provided: The tweets are from a user talking about penny stocks. They mention subscribers seeing gains over 4000% in the stock's value, which is a big positive. Also, mentions of Mrk and Lndg could be related to specific companies within that sector. Subscribing would be a passive investment strategy.

I should start by extracting the target stock symbol from each tweet. In this case, ""penny stocks"" is mentioned in some tweets, so maybe the symbol is something like MRK or LNDG. Each tweet can have both positive and negative factors related to that company.

For each tweet, I need to separate the factors into positive and negative. Positive factors might include mentions of gains, increasing value, upcoming earnings, etc. Negative factors could be concerns about losses, stock cuts, financials, etc.

Next, assess sentiment by evaluating how these factors influence investor sentiment. For example, a tweet with multiple positive factors would likely boost the stock's mood. Conversely, negative factors might lead to a decrease in sentiment.

Combining all the assessments from each tweet will give me an overall picture of whether the stock is expected to rise, stay the same, or fall. The user provided one output, so I need to make sure my conclusion matches that style and tag exactly.

I should also consider the context of the tweets—specific mentions like ""penny stocks"" might indicate a sector-wide sentiment, which could be positive or negative depending on expectations. The fact that the user is talking about upcoming earnings (gaining over 4000% in value) gives an expectation of strong growth.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure each tweet contributes positively, especially with the penny stocks mentioned. This would likely lead to a positive overall sentiment for the stock."
2014-06-15,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet and wants to determine its impact on stock price. First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweet. Looking at the tweet: "" todays movers to research $ gt $ ups $ mrk $ cag must have URL""

Hmm, it seems like ""mrk"" is mentioned as a stock symbol, so that's our target.

Next, I'll break down each relevant tweet. The given tweet only has one, but in general, I should consider how multiple tweets can affect sentiment. However, the user provided just this single tweet.

For each tweet factor, I need to separate positive and negative factors. But since there's only one tweet here, it's just ""mrk"". I'll evaluate its impact on investor sentiment.

The tweet mentions a ""must have URL,"" which sounds like it could be related to research or strategy for the company with symbol mrk. That might influence investor interest positively as they might want to know about their next steps.

Considering factors: Positive factor is favorable, Negative is neutral because while it's positive, other elements like ""url"" don't necessarily add to negative sentiment. Neutral would imply no clear impact yet."

2014-06-19,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet is ""$ mrk : mutations that prevent heart attacks upend the search for new drugs URL"". Hmm, ""mutations that prevent heart attacks"" makes me think about diseases being treated better. But it says ""upend the search for new drugs,"" which sounds like they're finding a way to make finding new drugs easier or more effective. That would probably be positive because if people can find new treatments better, maybe companies are more likely to come up with new drugs.

The second tweet is just ""$ mrk"" followed by a colon and another word but doesn't have any content. I don't think that's helpful here because it's incomplete or empty. So that tweet probably isn't relevant for analyzing the stock price impact.

So, focusing on the first tweet which provides information about new drugs being found more easily due to mutations preventing heart attacks. That seems like a positive signal for potential investors because companies might expand their product lines or markets more rapidly. More drugs available would mean increased revenue and perhaps better market presence, all of which can contribute positively to stock price.

Since the second tweet doesn't give any useful information, I don't need to consider that in my analysis. It's just a dead end. So combining both tweets, but only using the first one since it's relevant, I think this indicates positive trends for the company. Therefore, the overall sentiment should be Positive."
2014-06-20,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for the stock price impact on the given company. So, first, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the provided tweets, all of them mention ""mrk"", which is biotech stocks. The other words like mrk and ko are part of their symbols or names.

Now, each tweet seems to be talking about something related to biotech companies. For example, the first one mentions that three stocks are reiteration as a buy, and others. The second tweet talks about an index being clearer on some stock prices. The third is about Merck starting a tender offer foridenix. 

I think each of these tweets is suggesting positive actions or events related to biotech companies. They're not just listing names but also giving information about upcoming moves or strategies. So, each tweet seems to be reinforcing a positive outlook on the stock.

Looking at how they phrase things: ""3 stocks reiterated as a buy"" clearly indicates that investors are holding onto these stocks. ""The index is clearer on some stock prices"" suggests that the market believes these stocks are more valuable. And ""Merck starting tender offer..."" means they're planning to expand into another area, which can be seen as expansionary for the company.

All these factors combine to give a positive outlook, so combining them would make me conclude that the overall sentiment is positive. Therefore, I should use [Positive] as the answer."

2014-06-23,Negative,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on a stock price. The user provided three tweets and an example output. I need to go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll look at the target stock symbol from all the tweets combined. It seems like they're looking at Mutant Mr. X (MRK). So, I'm focusing on MRK's performance.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ auy % change URL also see : $ mrk $ mux $ vz $ emc ~"" Hmm, that looks like multiple variables: auy is possibly American Express, mux could be Microsoft, vz is volume, and emc might be energy. But since I'm focusing on MRK, maybe this tweet doesn't provide enough info about MRK itself.

Moving to the second tweet: ""$ mrk $ mux $ vz $ emc ~"" Similar structure here. It mentions MRK (us), which is relevant. Maybe it's a combination of factors like market movement and volume? If both MRK and Microsoft are involved, perhaps we're looking at their relative performance or something else.

The third tweet: ""$ mrk $ mrk $ mrk"" This one seems repetitive, just three times mentioning MRK. That could be testing if the user is seeing the same stock multiple times, maybe to ensure accuracy in analysis. The emphasis here is onMRK again without any additional info from other factors or variables.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let's take them one by one.

First tweet: ""auy % change URL also see : mrk ..."". Since it doesn't mention anything about MRK specifically, maybe this is a distraction or not relevant enough. So perhaps no immediate positive or negative factors from here.

Second tweet: ""mrk $ mux $ vz $ emc ~"" Here, we have MRK and Microsoft. If both are in the market, perhaps there's some relation between their movements or something else. But unless more context is given about their relative performance or other news, it's hard to say if this affects MRK.

Third tweet: ""mrk mrk mrk"". Without additional information from any factors like company performance, earnings, etc., this might be testing how the user handles multiple mentions of the same stock. It doesn't seem to contribute much to assessing sentiment towards MRK.

So overall, none of these tweets provide concrete evidence about either positive or negative sentiment related to Mutant Mr. X's stock price. The presence of other stocks and variables like volume isn't enough unless there are specific data points indicating movement or trends that could affect the stock.

I'm leaning towards a neutral response because without any significant information from the tweets, it's hard to gauge whether the company is undervalued, overvalued, or unaffected. But since all relevant factors aren't presented, I should consider that it might be a wash."

2014-06-25,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I've been given two tweets about a company and need to determine their impact on the stock price. The possible outcomes are positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""mrk showing bullish technicals with resistance at $59.07 (url)"". It seems like the company is Merck. Then in the second tweet: ""$ mrk - mast therapeutics mst - 188 would fit well in mercks drug development pi ... -> url stock stocks stockaction"". That also looks like it's about Merck, maybe with some reference to a drug development.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet. The first one mentions bullish technicals and resistance at $59.07. Technical analysis often involves support and resistance levels. Bullish can indicate potential buying interest or confirmation of expectations. If there's resistance, it might mean the stock is looking to stay at that price.

The second tweet seems a bit more detailed with ""mast therapeutics"" and mentions ""188"". Maybe it's talking about future targets or stock action. But without specific information on what they're targeting, it's hard to assess sentiment directly. I can't say if this is positive, negative, or neutral because the context isn't clear.

For each tweet, I should consider both factors: positive and negative. The first tweet gives some technical indicators but doesn't specify a price target yet. The second tweet is more speculative and lacks concrete information on performance or anything that would affect investors' opinions.

Since I don't have enough details to gauge the sentiment of the second tweet, maybe it's neutral because it's pointing towards future developments without clear direction. 

But wait, the first tweet mentions bullish technicals with resistance. Technical analysis can be a bit ambiguous without knowing the price level. If there are expectations that the stock is about to reach $59.07 again, that could push up the sentiment positively. However, it's also important to consider market trends and other factors influencing Merck's performance.

Putting this together: The first tweet hints at potential support or a pause in price movement. The second is speculative but without concrete info on success or failure. So maybe overall, it's neutral because we don't have enough data. However, considering the bullish technicals, perhaps leaning slightly positive. But I think it's more likely neutral because both tweets lack significant information that can tip the sentiment definitively.

Wait, actually, the first tweet might be pointing towards a potential buying interest. If the resistance is at $59.07 and they're bullish, maybe this indicates an expectation for a price increase or perhaps a break in support. But without knowing if $59.07 is below or above recent highs or lows, it's hard to say.

The second tweet doesn't give any immediate cues about performance, so maybe it's too speculative. So overall sentiment would be neutral because both tweets lack enough information to determine direction clearly."
2014-06-26,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for the company. The user provided two specific tweets and wants an overall conclusion using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""buy $ ceru successful $ lly venture as $ rcpt to tacklecancer > lowfloat profit stocks $ ipo $ achn $ blue $ mrk $ pfe $ gild $ vrx $ jpm $ ms $ gs"". It seems like the stock symbol here might be ""ceru"", but that's not standard. Maybe it's a typo or irrelevant. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to some other company, but without more context, I'll assume it's a typo and focus on the meaningful part: ""buy $ mrk"" which mentions MRK.

Wait, actually, ""mrk"" is the stock ticker symbol for Johnson & Morgan. So the first tweet says ""buy $ ceru successful...""> and then mentions ""lowfloat profit stocks"", ""ipo"", etc., but it also includes ""mrk"". Maybe that's part of the message? Not entirely sure.

Second tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER i'd go with $ mrk"" – this seems more direct, mentioning MRK specifically. The wording suggests the user is suggesting buying shares or investing in MRK.

Now, processing each tweet. For the first tweet, I don't have a clear target stock because it's confusing due to typos and mentions of other stocks like ceru, lly, etc., which might not be related. So perhaps it's missing information, making it hard to analyze.

For the second tweet, the user is directly talking about $ mrk. The mention of ""i'd go with"" suggests a positive intention, maybe implying confidence in MRK's performance or potential. The other mentions like lowfloat profit and IPO don't seem related unless they're supportive factors.

I think the first tweet might not be providing clear information about the stock. So focusing on the second tweet: the user is saying ""i'd go with $ mrk,"" which could mean they are planning to buy or invest in MRK, possibly positive, so the overall sentiment would be [Positive].

Wait, but I'm only given two tweets and need to conclude based on them. The first might not have a clear stock symbol, making its impact hard to assess. However, since the second tweet seems more actionable and mentions a specific stock, it's the one that tells me to go with MRK. So overall sentiment is positive because the user is suggesting investment in a stock they're planning to go with."
2014-06-27,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I need to analyze a couple of tweets and determine whether they're going to have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on a company's stock price. The user provided two tweets, and from the previous response, it looks like each tweet was analyzed separately with factors and sentiment.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""stocks to hold onto $ i eog mrk amazon stockmarket url"". Hmm, okay. I see ""stocks"" mentioned, which is a general term but might not be specific enough. The words ""mrk"" and ""amazon"" are keywords. So maybe this is pointing towards Amazon or a company related to those. It also mentions the stock market URL, so perhaps it's targeting investors via that platform.

Now, looking at the second tweet: ""$ grcu % change url also see : $ qasp mrk s f ~"". This one has ""grcu"", which I know is a stock symbol for Microsoft. Then there are some percentages and other terms like ""qasp"" and ""mrk"", again pointing to Amazon or its competitors.

So, both tweets mention Amazon's stock symbols: mrk (Amazon) and grcu (Microsoft). It looks like the user is trying to direct investors to watch these stocks because of their high valuations. The use of ""also see"" suggests they might be part of a strategy to stay informed about upcoming market changes.

In terms of factors, both tweets are positive in that Amazon and Microsoft are being mentioned as companies to hold onto due to potential future performance. However, the language is somewhat technical with specific stock names and market URLs, which might imply confidence in their future growth or profitability.

Sentiment-wise, since both mentions positive keywords like ""mrk"" and ""grcu"" along with related terms, it seems that the user is encouraging investors to stay informed about Amazon's performance. This could be seen as a cautious approach without overreacting, keeping the focus on the company's fundamentals rather than just trends or hype.

Putting this together, the overall sentiment would likely be positive because both tweets are reinforcing the idea that holding onto these stocks makes sense given their current valuations and related discussions."

2014-06-30,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price for a company. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually to see what they're saying and how that might affect investors.

The first tweet says: ""video : dow movers : $ ba $ mrk stocks URL"". It sounds like a link is being provided and mentions something about stock symbols. Not sure if that's relevant on its own unless it points to specific stocks, but it's possible the user is tracking movements or something related.

The second tweet is more concrete: ""it could be breakout time on $ mrk $ irm $ spn $ tur visit URL"". This seems like a potential news event. The mention of multiple stock symbols and terms like ""breakout time"" makes me think that there's an upcoming event, maybe an earnings report or something significant related to the stock. If it's a major release around a company, especially if it's positive for their operations or market presence, investors might be excited.

The third tweet says: ""rt AT_USER $ mrk announces data from ph3 study on emend ( aprepitant ) for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea & vomiting ( cinv ) …"". This is even more detailed. It mentions an R.T., which could be a typo or a reference to a user's tweet, and an announcement about a Phase 3 study on an medication. If this study results in positive developments, especially regarding reducing side effects from chemotherapy, that would likely boost the stock price because it shows improved treatment options.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is linking to information. The second suggests something upcoming, possibly good news. The third adds more detailed info about a recent, potentially beneficial study. So, multiple positive signals suggesting potential for an increase in stock value.

I don't see any negative mentions here, so I'm leaning towards a Positive overall sentiment."

First, I need to identify the target stock. Looking at the tweets, they mention ""erbb"", so that's my target.

Next, each tweet seems to be a separate factor influencing investor sentiment towards the stock. I'll go through each one step by step.

The first tweet says: ""$ erbb stock forum URL also see : $ mrk $ avew $ kgc $ wmt ~"". This looks like it's directing investors to check ""mrk"", ""avew"", ""kgc"", and ""wmt"" on the ERBB forum. These are likely stocks that are either going up or down, but I'm not sure about their prices yet.

The second tweet is: ""$ are you hanging on to $ mrk $ gnw $ cbt $ nuan try this URL"". Here, it seems like people are checking ""mrk"" and ""gnw"", which might be related to the ERBB stock. It's also asking if I'm holding onto them.

Now, considering each tweet's impact:

1. The first tweet is a general direction for investors. It could suggest that other stocks are in the market or about to change, but without specific prices, it's hard to assess the immediate effect on ERBB. However, it might provide some context.

2. The second tweet seems more active. Investors are checking relevant stocks and checking if they're ""hanging on"". This could indicate that people are bearish because they're looking for more support or have seen a drop in their previous investments. It's a bit of a mix—some positive checks, some negative, but overall, it might suggest cautiousness.

Looking at the factors:

- Positive factors: The company is conducting a forum check on other stocks.
- Negative factors: Investors are checking if they're holding onto certain stocks, which could indicate uncertainty or fear about their performance.

Considering both aspects, while there's some positive info, the overall sentiment seems to be cautious. The investors are actively looking for support without immediate buy pressure but also showing interest in others, which might lead them to avoid buying despite potential gains. However, it doesn't look like there's a strong push towards rising or falling.

Therefore, I would lean towards a [Neutral] sentiment because the impact is not overwhelmingly positive nor negative; instead, it's more of a moderate view based on mixed information."
2014-07-03,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on a stock's future price. The user has provided some specific steps, so I'll follow them carefully.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""pennystock research on $ mrvl $ car $ mrk $ goog i suggest URL"". Hmm, that doesn't seem to directly mention a stock symbol. Maybe it's not about MRO or something else. I should check if there are other mentions of stocks in this list.

Then, for each tweet, I have to separate the Positive and Negative factors. The user already did this by breaking down the tweet into points like suggesting URLs, researching companies, etc. Each point is labeled as ""Positive"" if it's beneficial or neutral if it's not, and ""Negative"" if it could harm the stock.

In the first tweet, it mentions researching $ mrvl $ car and $ mrk $ goog, which I think are MRO (Marketing Research Organization) and Google. That doesn't ring a bell as a specific company. Maybe it's related to those sectors?

Next, assessing sentiment is about how each point affects investor sentiment. If the tweet suggests certain things, that can either push investors positively or negatively.

After analyzing both tweets, I need to combine these factors to decide if the stock should be [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

Wait, in this case, both tweets are just about researching $ mrvl and $ mrk. If neither of these is a significant company or well-known, then their impact might be neutral or even negative. So I'll go with [Neutral]."
2014-07-04,Neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the impact on the stock price based on the given tweets. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from both tweets is $ mrk. That's Michael Pson, Inc., a tech company in the semiconductor industry.

Now, analyzing each tweet:

The first tweet says "" todays movers to research $ thrx $ ter $ mrk $ bwp try this URL"". The word ""movers"" here could imply potential increases or declines, but without specific information on how that relates to Mrk's stock. It seems a bit vague.

The second tweet is ""$ bmin short sales URL also see : $ mrk $ hemp $ bbry $ xom ~"", mentioning BMin, another tech company in semiconductors. Short sales are speculative trading strategies and don't directly indicate investor sentiment about MrK. They can affect stock prices but aren't specific enough to gauge a positive or negative impact on MrK's stock.

Both tweets are vague, with no clear indication of how they'll affect the stock price. There's no mention of earnings reports, news, economic indicators, or other factors that could influence stock performance. 

Since none of the information in the tweets provides any concrete clues about the stock's direction or potential movement, it seems like there isn't enough data to assess a positive, neutral, or negative impact on MrK. Therefore, I should conclude that there's no significant impact based on these tweets."
2014-07-05,Missing,File not found
2014-07-06,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. The user provided four tweets, but they all seem to be discussing stock-related terms like metrics, liquidity, economy, etc., without any specific context about the target company or their financial performance. 

In tweet 1 and 2, they mention things like $ mrk (MSFT), which is Microsoft's ticker symbol. But these are just names; I don't have any information on what MSFT is doing right now. It could be up, down, or stable.

Tweets 3 and 4 talk about Dow Jones indices, specific stocks (like cat, intc, mrk, etc.), and economic data. Again, without knowing the current market conditions or the company's performance, it's hard to assess their impact on MSFT.

Since all tweets are speculative or discussing broader markets rather than specific financial statements or news related to a particular stock, I can't make an informed judgment about the stock's price movement. Therefore, the overall sentiment is neutral because there's no concrete information affecting the stock."
2014-07-07,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I'll take it step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. I see ""mrk"" in the first tweet. So the company is probably related to Medicinal Research Labs, Inc., which makes medical treatments and research, especially leukemia treatments. That's an interesting area because advancements in such areas can impact both individual patients and the broader healthcare sector.

Now, each tweet is a separate factor. I need to break down each one into positive and negative factors.

The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER [ $ $ ] novartis leukemia treatment gets ' breakthrough ' status .. URL $ mrk biotech stocks."" The user mentions a breakthrough in treatments for leukemia from Novartis, which is part of Biotech. That's definitely a positive sign because it could lead to better patients and potentially higher stock prices if the company sees growth.

The second tweet lists multiple S&P 500 companies: aapl, jnj, exc, mrk, mo, gild, msft, t, so, dvn, pm, aep, v, sbux, wmt, tgt. I know that the S&P 500 is a major stock market index tracking 500 large companies, and its performance can be influenced by various factors. Companies listed in this index often have significant revenues or are part of a diversified portfolio.

Each of these stocks is from different sectors: apl is semiconductor, jnj and mo might be financials or utilities, exc could be electronics or chemicals, etc. This mix suggests a broad market environment rather than one centered on any single sector. But individual companies' performance can vary widely depending on their own strategies and market reactions.

So each tweet is indicating that these companies are performing well in the S&P 500. However, it's important to consider whether these stocks are collectively improving or if some are declining while others are still strong. If several companies across sectors are underperforming, it could indicate an overall negative trend for the broader market.

Putting this together: The first tweet is positive because of a breakthrough in medical treatment, which might boost the product portfolio, thus positively affecting the stock. But with multiple stocks mentioned and varying performance trends, there's uncertainty about whether the overall S&P 500 will improve or not.

I'm leaning towards the overall sentiment being neutral because while there are some positive factors (like the breakthrough in treatment), the list of companies doesn't provide a clear direction for market-wide improvement. Investors might be cautious due to diversification, but without specific signs of growth across the board, it's hard to say if it'll tip either positively or negatively.

I should also consider that sometimes even if some parts of the market are doing well, others could take a hit, especially with geopolitical issues, economic uncertainties, or company-specific news. However, in this case, the focus is more on stock performance rather than broader political factors.

So after evaluating all these points, I think the overall sentiment is neutral because while there's some positive news from a breakthrough treatment, the list of companies and their individual performances don't give a clear trend."
2014-07-08,Negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of HOMRK or Merck. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

First tweet: ""$ mrk : thursday's analyst moves : hewlett-packard company , h & r block inc , merck ... URL"". Hmm, this seems to be about a tweet going live, mentioning their analyst move and the companies involved. I'm not sure what ""thursday's"" refers to here—it might just be a placeholder or typo. Maybe it's supposed to say something about their performance? Not too clear yet.

Second tweet: "" insider selling : weir mirian m . graddick sells 180,047 shares of merck & co . stock $ mrk URL"". Okay, this looks like Merck is selling a lot of shares. Selling shares usually affects investor sentiment negatively because it can push prices down or reduce growth expectations. Insider transactions often have significant consequences on stock prices.

Now, combining both tweets: The first seems to be an announcement about the company's performance, which could indicate a positive factor if they're improving. But the second tweet is clearly an insider transaction selling shares, which would likely be negative for their outlook.

I'm not sure how these two factors interact. The positive note might counterbalance the negative action, but the significant share sale makes me think it's strong and negative. However, since the first tweet is still live, the company might already have a good track record or some positive developments. But given that there's an inside sale, I'm leaning towards the overall sentiment being Negative because the immediate actions are causing price changes.

Wait, but how do I combine these? The first tweet could be interpreted as a positive news point, maybe even a better Q&A session. So it might be a bit of both: mixed positive and negative factors. But the second tweet is a definite sell-off which is more impactful on sentiment than the first.

I think overall, given that there's an insider transaction selling shares for a large volume, I'll conclude with Negative."
2014-07-09,Positive,"Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user provided a query where they want me to analyze some tweets about stock prices and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for a given company. They gave an example with two tweets, but in this case, only one tweet is provided. 

First, I should figure out how to extract the target stock from the tweet. The user's query includes several words like ""mrk"", "" pcln"", and ""click rate_limit_exceeded"". From these, it seems like the stock symbol might be ""mrc"" since that's a well-known tech company in the mobile space. But wait, is there another possibility? Maybe ""pcln""? Hmm, I think mrc is more likely because of the ""mrk"" which is known.

Next, I need to understand what each tweet says. The first tweet is titled ""bearish or bullish on these stocks data acgl mrk pcln click rate_limit_exceeded"". So it's talking about both bullish and bearish views on these stocks. But where does acgl come in? Maybe that's a typo or extra information not directly relevant to the stock analysis.

I should separate the factors into positive and negative. The tweet says bullish, which I think means investors are optimistic, but then mentions ""click rate_limit_exceeded"" which sounds like it could be a concern. Click rates might relate to performance metrics or something else about the stocks, maybe related to revenue growth or customer interaction.

Evaluating sentiment, the positive part is that there's some bullish focus on these stocks, but the negative factor points towards concerns about click rate limits. I'm not sure how significant ""click rate_limit_exceeded"" is in determining overall sentiment. It might be a minor point compared to the broader bullish tone.

Putting it all together, the tweet has mixed signals: some optimism but also some worries. Without knowing how critical these concerns are, it's hard to say definitively whether the overall impact on stock price is positive or negative. But maybe the main focus is still on the stocks being bought up because of their outlook, so perhaps it's leaning more towards positive.

Wait, actually, in the example provided earlier, when a tweet says ""mrk click rate_limit_exceeded"", it was considered positive. That makes sense because the user mentioned the stock symbol and clicked the link with data acgl. So maybe even if there are some negative factors, the main focus is on the bullish part.

In this case, since the tweet is titled with a positive outlook (bullish) but includes both positive and negative elements, I think the overall sentiment should still be considered positive because the main message is about optimism."
2014-07-10,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the user has given me some tweets related to a stock and wants me to determine whether each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative impact on the company's future stock price. They also provided an example output which I can use as a guide.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the tweets. The first tweet mentions ""mrk,"" so that must be merck, right? I think merck is short for Merck & Company, so they're probably a healthcare company. That helps narrow things down because it gives me the name of the stock I'm analyzing.

Now, looking at each tweet one by one. The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER jounce taps merck vet to lead cancer drug push URL $ mrk"". Let's break this down. It seems like someone is calling out the user on Twitter (the 'rt' probably stands for retweet) and then mentions Merck, urging them to focus on a cancer drug. The tweet ends with a link to some URL where they're making a request or message. The price symbol $ mrk indicates that this is their stock.

So, the factors here are positive because it's encouraging Merck to invest in a cancer drug, which could potentially increase their revenue and profits. Also, the mention of a vaccine strategy might positively impact their business operations. Negative factors aren't immediately obvious from this tweet; there doesn't seem to be anything that indicates a negative sentiment or warning about the stock.

Putting it all together: positive factors are driving investment in a potential cancer drug, which is favorable for their stock price. Since there's no strong negative information here, the overall sentiment should be positive."

2014-07-14,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral towards a company's stock price. The user provided some tweets and wants me to analyze them step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, it seems like there aren't any listed in the tweets, but from the tweet ""johnson & johnson earnings : can pharma keep stoking growth ? .. URL $ mrk biotech stocks"", I think the focus is on Johnson & Johnson (Johnson) and Biogen (Biogen). But since the stock symbol isn't given, maybe it's referring to another company or it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps they're targeting a specific sector like pharmaceuticals or biotech.

Next, each tweet is broken down into factors: Positive and Negative. So I need to parse each one. The first tweet mentions Johnson & Johnson earnings and asks if pharma can keep the growth momentum. It's about their performance relative to the broader market (mrk and biogen are stock symbols for pharmaceutical companies), which could suggest that the tweet is evaluating how well these stocks are doing compared to others in the same sector.

Now, assessing sentiment. The user wants to know whether each tweet will influence investor sentiment towards the company. The tweet seems neutral because it's asking a question rather than providing a positive or negative outlook on the stock price. It doesn't state an opinion but invites the reader to think about their own views on how the stocks are performing.

Putting this together, since there's no explicit word like ""positive"" or ""negative,"" just a question, the overall sentiment is neutral because the tweet isn't providing any directional information. Investors might decide based on their analysis of other factors and trends, but since it's not a direct statement about the stock performance, it doesn't tip the balance."
2014-07-15,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a company. Let's break down each tweet.

First, identify the target stock from both tweets. The first tweet mentions avoiding mistakes related to $ fls $ sgen $ mrk $ rax stock URL, which probably refers to Amazon (AMZN) since I'm aware of that stock symbol. The second tweet talks about ""watching"" $ abbvadis ($abbav), $ mxim ($mxim), and $ mrk (MSFT). So the target stocks are AMZN, BBVAD, and MSFT.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors and assess the sentiment. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""avoid mistakes like $ fls $ sgen $ mrk $ rax stock URL"". The words ""$ fls"" probably don't make much sense in this context. The mention of avoiding mistakes is more about coding errors, which are unrelated to investing or stock prices. So I can say this has no positive or negative factors because the content doesn't relate to financial analysis.

Next tweet: ""this weeks stocks you should watch $ abbvadis ($abbav), $ mxim ($mxim), and $ mrk (msft) stock URL"". This seems like a call for investors to follow these three companies. From an investment perspective, this is a positive sign because it's encouraging others to take action related to these stocks.

So now, combining the factors: none of the tweets have positive factors related to the target stocks. The first tweet isn't informative, and the second tweet suggests that viewers should watch these stocks, which could indicate increased demand or attention towards them. 

For sentiment analysis, since there are no positive or negative points in either tweet, I need to consider if there's any underlying sentiment from the companies themselves. But without more context about their performance, like revenue, earnings, etc., it's hard to say. However, the tweet does suggest that these stocks could be on the radar of some investors, which might mean they're being watched or monitored.

I should also consider whether these tweets are from a news source or an investment firm. If they're from a reputable source like a financial blog or a stock rating website, it would imply that the sentiment is more likely positive, especially if such calls for monitoring can attract attention and lead to increased activity related to those stocks.

Putting it all together: The second tweet gives some indication of potential investor interest in these stocks without providing specific information about their performance. This could translate into a slight positive impact as more people might be watching the companies or following them, which is a common signal for stock price movements. However, since there's no clear call to action related to profits, revenue, or other metrics that directly affect the stock price, it's hard to assign a definite positive or negative sentiment."
2014-07-16,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of the given tweets on the stock price of a company, specifically focusing on whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. The user provided an example output where they concluded ""[Neutral]"" based on certain factors.

Looking at the tweet: ""$ mrk : jounce taps merck vet to lead cancer drug push URL""

Hmm, first I should identify the target stock symbol here. It looks like ""mrk"" is the symbol. So we're talking about Merck & Co., Inc.

Now, let's break down the tweet. The phrase ""jounce taps merck vet to lead cancer drug push URL"" seems a bit off, but maybe it's trying to convey that Merck is actively promoting a health-related drug, possibly for cancer treatment. The use of ""veterinarian"" might indicate their focus on treating patients who are veterans or similar. 

So the tweet seems positive because it's talking about leading a cancer drug push, which suggests they're investing in research and development focused on serious medical issues. This could boost investor confidence as Merck is seen as advancing treatments for diseases.

Other factors: While there's no mention of negative tweets, the focus on a health-focused product might be a strong positive indicator. The lack of negative language here supports a positive overall sentiment.

Considering all this, I'd say the tweet has a positive impact on Merck's stock price."
2014-07-17,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to analyze some tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price. The tweet provided is just ""stocks you might want to sell $ ibkr $ ncr $ mrk $ usd worth a look rate_limit_exceeded"". 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweet. It looks like the word 'ibkr' might be the ticker symbol for a specific stock. But without knowing which one exactly, I can't get precise info. So, maybe it's better to just consider that any mention of these stocks in tweets could indicate broader sentiment towards them.

Next, looking at each part: ""separate the Factors"" and ""assess Sentiment."" The tweet is a bit unclear on what factors are being considered. It mentions 'stocks you might want to sell' which suggests selling interest or short selling. However, it doesn't specify the context of this action.

The second part is about rate_limit_exceeded. I'm not sure what that refers to. It could be an API limit in a stock quote or related to trading rules. Without more context, it's hard to assess sentiment based on this.

Since there are no other tweets provided, I can't combine multiple factors. I should probably consider the possibility of a broader sell-off due to the mention of stocks and potential regulations, which could decrease investor confidence in some companies.

I'm not entirely sure about the implications for any particular stock mentioned. It's possible that selling these stocks is part of a strategy, but without knowing if it's a buy or sell decision, I can't determine the overall effect on the stock price.

Given all this uncertainty, I might lean towards a neutral stance, assuming that the information isn't enough to make a confident conclusion. However, considering potential regulatory issues could lead me to consider [Negative]. But again, without more context, it's risky."

2014-07-24,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. Let me break down each tweet and see what they're saying.

First tweet: ""$ amgn it could be breaktout time on $ mrk $ flo $ rt nasdaq URL"". The word ""breakout"" seems important here, suggesting that something big is about to happen related to Amgen or maybe their stock (MRK). I'll note the key words and the upcoming event. It doesn't mention any positive or negative factors right now; it's more of a prediction.

Second tweet: ""$ kr seeking the next hot pennystock $ mrk $ pki $ pcln give it a try rate_limit_exceeded"". This one has several parts. ""Penny stock"" indicates a new investment opportunity, so this could be good for investors. However, there are terms like ""rate_limit_exceeded"", which might imply something about trading limits or regulatory changes affecting the stock. I'm not sure if that's positive or negative, but it adds to the idea of exploring opportunities.

Now, considering these tweets, they're both looking for investment ideas and offer a chance to try something with new developments, like rate limits being exceeded. They mention ""penny stocks,"" which could be attractive because pennies are often seen as value stocks. The part about ""breakout time"" in the first tweet suggests that there might be an upcoming event related to Amgen or their stock, which is usually a positive sign for investors.

Putting it all together: The tweets are looking promising for new investments and potential upcoming events. They're offering a way to try something, which could drive interest and possibly lead to a rebound in the stock price. However, I should also consider any negative factors they might mention but don't see clearly here.

So, considering positive aspects like new opportunities and anticipation of a significant event, the overall sentiment seems neutral because while there's optimism about growth potential and potential new investments, it's not clear if it directly drives up or down the stock price."
2014-07-25,Neutral,"Alright, so I have this query where the user is asking about analyzing tweets to determine their impact on stock prices for a company. They've provided specific steps and an example output, but they want me to conclude with a single line using one of three tags: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, let's break down what each part of their request entails. The user wants a clear analysis where I identify the target stock from the tweets, then evaluate each tweet for positive or negative factors and sentiment. Finally, combine these to decide on overall impact.

Looking at the sample input, they provided just one tweet: ""earnings news on $ ge $ btya $ mrk $ s financial URL"". From this, I can see it's about earnings reports from three companies: Ge, BNY, and S&P Financial. Earnings reports are typically positive because they indicate future performance.

Now, the user wants me to process each tweet step by step. Each step involves identifying the stock symbol, separating factors into positive and negative, assessing sentiment, and then summarizing all factors to decide on the overall impact.

But wait, I don't have access to the tweets yet. The initial response given is just a conclusion line without any analysis of the individual tweets. So, perhaps in my thinking process, I'm focusing only on this tweet as an example. But for the user's actual use case, they might have multiple tweets, and each needs to be analyzed separately.

However, since the user's query provided only one tweet, maybe they're testing whether I can identify the stock symbol or not recognize it. In their output, they already concluded ""[Neutral]"" because earnings reports are positive for future performance.

But let me think about this more carefully. Maybe there's a catch here. Earnings reports typically show profitability, which is a positive sign for investors. It can boost confidence, especially if the earnings are expected to be strong. So in this case, it's a Positive tweet.

But I'm not sure if that's always the case. Sometimes, earnings reports might come out with high valuations or unexpected results. However, based on standard economic indicators, earnings news generally indicates future performance.

So, considering all this, my analysis would support the conclusion of ""[Positive]"" for this particular tweet."
2014-07-26,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on the stock price for a given company. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol mentioned: $mrk. Wait, that looks like a common stock ticker, maybe from a specific company. I remember it's related to Microsoft, but I'm not sure exactly which one. Either way, I need to focus on its impact based on the tweets provided.

Now, the tweets given is just one: ""$ mrk traders brace for summer's busiest week URL"". Let me look at each part of this tweet.

1. The beginning says ""$ mrk traders brace for summer's busiest week URL."" Hmm, that seems a bit odd to me. I'm not sure if it's a typo or if it's trying to convey something specific. Maybe the ""URL"" is a placeholder or an example word. But I think what it's trying to say is that Mrk (which might be Microsoft) traders are planning for a busy week in summer, possibly related to some event or project they're involved in.

2. The structure seems to be: [Stock ticker] people brace for something. That sounds positive because people are looking forward and maybe investing more now before the market closes. So brace means ready to go, signaling optimism about upcoming events.

Putting it together, this tweet is expressing confidence that the stock will do well in the near future by preparing for a busy week. It's showing anticipation and readiness, which is typical of positive sentiment towards the stock price.

I'm also considering the term ""URL"" – maybe it's an abbreviation or code. In some contexts, URl could refer to something like URL, but without more context, I can't be sure. However, in this case, since it's just part of the phrase ""summer's busiest week,"" I think it might be a placeholder meant to say ""summer's busy week.""

So, overall, the tweet is expressing anticipation and readiness, which is positive. There are no negative or neutral indicators here; it's more about looking forward rather than making predictions that could go negatively."
2014-07-27,Missing,File not found
2014-07-28,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to analyze the impact of two tweets on the stock price of a company and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. 

First, I need to figure out which stock these tweets are referring to. Looking at the tweets, they mention something like ""AT_USER must-watch earnings,"" which makes me think they're related to companies that deal with stock trading or financial services because the hashtags include 'user' and relevant sector words. So maybe it's a company in finance or tech.

Next, I'll break down each tweet one by one. For each tweet, I need to identify positive and negative factors and evaluate the sentiment towards the stock price. Let me list them out:

1. Tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER must-watch upcoming earnings : mon - $ hlf tue - $ pfe $ mrk wed - $ yelp $ wfm thur - $ twtr $ lnkd $ tsla $ xom fri - $ brka URL""
2. Tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER must-watch earnings this week mon : $ hlf tue : $ twtr $ pfe $ mrk wed : $ yelp $ gpro thur : $ tsla $ xom $ lnkd fri : $ brkb URL""

Looking at the tweets, they all mention upcoming earnings, which suggests it's about future performance. The hashtags include ""user,"" ""earnings,"" and words like 'hlf' (highly unlikely), 'pfe' (probably a typo for PFE, which stands for Price-to-Earnings ratio), 'mrk,' 'yelp,' etc.

I need to analyze the sentiment on each tweet. 

For Tweet 1:
- The positive aspects are mentions of upcoming earnings, which is positive because it's a key point affecting stock prices.
- There's no explicit negative mention about expectations or downfalls. It seems focused on what's happening now.

For Tweet 2:
- Similar structure as Tweet 1; mentions future earnings without any indication of negative factors.

Now, since both tweets are similar in content and focus on upcoming earnings, the overall sentiment would likely be positive because it reflects investor anticipation of a good performance.

I should make sure there's no hidden information or conflicting points. In this case, both tweets are about earnings, which is a common financial indicator that can influence stock prices positively if investors expect strong future performance."
2014-07-29,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of the company based on these tweets. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one and parse out their factors.

First tweet: $ mrk and $ pfe have very different views on inverting rt AT_USER pfizer refusing to rule out tax deals URL. Hmm, I don't recognize ""rt AT_USER"" here. Maybe it's a typo or something else? The main thing is that they have differing opinions on PFizer. But without knowing their positions, it's hard to assess the impact.

Second tweet: AT_USER your estimate for $ mrk q2 2014 has been scored – URL. This seems to be an update on Mrk's second quarter earnings. It says the score is updated, so that could affect investor expectations and therefore sentiment towards the stock.

Third tweet: rt AT_USER $ mrk posts q2 eps of 85 cents vs 81 cent estimate. Here, they're comparing their reported Q2 EPS to their estimates. The number seems slightly higher than expected, but it's a positive sign for the company, especially if EPS is good. So this shows a positive sentiment.

Fourth tweet: rt AT_USER merck & co . , inc . $ mrk tops q2 eps by 5c URL. Similar to the third tweet, this is about Mrk's Q2 EPS compared to their estimates. This time, it's an increase of 5 cents. That could indicate confidence in their financial performance.

Fifth tweet: r & d costs going up at $ mrk in h2 - that's a win for perlmutter . Focus is on r & d progress , not failure - ( so the crl gets swept out quietly ). This one talks about R&D costs. It says costs are going up, which could be bad news if it affects their ability to develop new drugs. But it also mentions focusing on progress rather than failure, implying that even with higher costs, they might continue making progress silently. This could indicate a mixed sentiment because while the company is facing challenges, it's managing them effectively.

Sixth tweet: merck beats forecasts , newer drugs offset impact of generics .. URL $ mrk biotech stocks. The mention of beating forecasts and newer drugs which are biotech stocks suggests that they're performing well in their biotech sector, possibly outperforming the market or industry benchmarks. This is a positive sign for investors looking into biotech stocks.

Now, combining all these points:

- First tweet: unclear, but differing views on PTizer could be either.
- Second tweet: Q2 earnings update; this is a direct financial impact that can increase stock price.
- Third tweet: Positive EPS compared to estimate.
- Fourth tweet: Another positive EPS comparison.
- Fifth tweet: R&D costs up, which might mean the company is facing challenges but managing them. If they're successful in their progress without major setbacks, it could be a good sign for future performance, which is neutral or positive depending on context.
- Sixth tweet: Positive outlook on biotech stocks, which can boost stock price.

But wait, if PTizer was refusing to rule out tax deals, that's confusing. If PFizer has tax deals, then perhaps that affects their financials negatively. But without more info, it's hard to tell.

So, overall, the main positive points are second, third, fourth, and sixth tweets. The fifth tweet is about R&D which could be mixed but with a positive note since they're focusing on progress. So, considering all these factors, the stock might have a positive sentiment because of improving earnings (second, third, fourth), new drugs in biotech (sixth), and some positive news from R&D."
2014-07-30,Negative,"Okay, let's see what I have here. The user has provided two tweets and asked me to analyze their impact on the stock price using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Hmm, wait a minute, the first tweet is just $ mrk : u . s . stocks open higher ; dow above 17,000 URL. That's not a real stock symbol; it looks like some kind of link to a website. I'm confused about that. Maybe it's a typo or something else? The second tweet doesn't specify the stock either. 

Alright, since both tweets are just URLs with numbers and words, they don't provide specific information about the company's stock. Without knowing which stock the symbols correspond to, it's impossible to determine their impact on the future stock price. I can't assess whether something is positive, neutral, or negative because there's no data or context related to that stock. 

So, without more information, my conclusion should be neutral because I don't have enough details to make an informed judgment. That makes sense. Yeah, I'll go with Neutral."
2014-07-31,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

The first tweet is ""$ mrk - stocks mixed ; fed tapers and gdp better than forecast -> URL stockaction"". The words here include ""stocks mixed"" which suggests some uncertainty, ""fed tapers"" indicating economic conditions, and ""gdp better than forecast."" These terms might indicate that the economy is cooling down a bit. Maybe the Fed's policies have affected investor sentiment negatively.

The second tweet is ""$ mrk - fed rate higher than expected ; stock price drops 2%"" here. The ""fed rate higher than expected"" implies concern about inflation, which could be bad for company earnings and stock prices. The stock price dropping by 2% adds to the negative impact.

The third tweet is ""$ mrk - fed rate higher ; fed policy tightening affects margins -> URL stockaction"". This one combines the Fed's higher rates with tighter policies that are affecting margins, suggesting ongoing economic challenges. tighter margins could lead to lower profitability and a drop in stock price.

The fourth tweet is ""$ mrk - fed tapers and gdp better than forecast -> URL stockaction"". It says Fed tapers and GDP is better than expected. Tapering could be a positive move as it might reduce inflationary pressures, which would help the company's earnings. Plus, a better GDP forecast can boost investor confidence.

Putting it all together: The first tweet shows some mixed signals but not strong. The second and third tweets indicate economic concerns from Fed rates, which are likely to hurt. However, the fourth tweet suggests a positive outlook due to favorable GDP numbers. Overall, there's a mix of mixed signals and significant negative factors that could weigh on the stock price.

I'm leaning towards [Neutral] because while the Fed's actions are affecting investor sentiment negatively, some positive indicators like improved margins or GDP are still present, which might mitigate some of the concerns."
2014-08-01,Negative,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for the stock ""NANU"" based on the provided rules and examples. 

First, I need to extract the stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""avoid mistakes like $ ggg $ mrk $ qcom $ nuan must have URL"". Wait, that seems a bit confusing because I don't recognize most of these symbols. Maybe it's a typo or part of a different context. The user provided an example where they extracted ""NANU"" from the tweet. So perhaps in this case, we're focusing on ""NANU"".

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate Positive and Negative factors. However, some tweets are confusing, like ""avoid mistakes like $ ggg $ mrk $ qcom $ nuan must have URL"". It's unclear what these symbols mean. Maybe it's not a stock symbol but part of another text. Since the user provided an example with ""NANU"", perhaps all other relevant factors in this tweet are irrelevant or can be ignored because we're focusing on ""NANU"".

Assuming that only ""NANU"" is relevant, let's look at each tweet to see if it mentions NANU. 

1. The first tweet mentions $ nuan must have URL but doesn't specify it's related to NANU.
2. If there are other tweets without a mention of NANU, those can be ignored.

Since all the provided tweets don't clearly indicate whether they're about NANU, I might need to consider that none of them are relevant. Therefore, for each tweet, if it doesn't mention NANU, we'll treat it as Neutral or perhaps ignore it.

Putting it together: No tweets are mentioning NANU. Since there's no information on how these tweets influence investor sentiment towards NANU, the overall sentiment is neutral."
2014-08-02,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the company's stock price. Let me start by identifying the target stock symbol from each tweet. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER best buys $ 10 + $ zdpy , $ mdbx , $ cbca , $ cara , $ cbds , $ jobi , $ gwph , $ ntri , $ nktr , $ ipsey , $ abbv , $ mrk , $ abt , $ sny"". It mentions several exchanges and symbols, but without a specific stock symbol, I'm confused. Maybe it's AT_USER? Not sure yet.

The second tweet: ""are you investing in $ thrx $ urbn $ mrk $ cag liquidity URL"". This seems to be aboutthrux, urban, mrk, and cag. Again, no specific stock identified here.

The third tweet: ""$ kss get more info on $ mrk $ s $ s nse URL"". It mentions mrk again, but the factors are unclear. Maybe it's referring to a specific product or market?

I'm missing some information about each tweet. For example, which stocks are being referred to in each tweet? Without identifying the target stock symbol and understanding what each tweet is focusing on, I can't accurately assess the sentiment impact. The first tweet talks about best buys across various exchanges, so perhaps it's about a broad sector or multiple companies. The second seems like a query related to investing in several stocks. The third mentions mrk but lacks context.

I think without knowing which stock each tweet is referring to, I can't determine the sentiment effect on its stock price. There might be other stocks involved that aren't mentioned here. Maybe the user provided incomplete information or made multiple tweets about different aspects of a company's stock."
2014-08-03,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided some tweets and asked for an analysis on their impact on a stock's future price. They've given specific steps to follow: first identify the target stock by extracting its symbol from each tweet, then analyze each tweet as positive or negative factors, assess sentiment per tweet, and finally combine these into an overall sentiment. The output needs to be one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

Looking at the tweets provided, the only one mentions $ mrk $ which I think stands for $ Mark $. So the stock symbol is probably ""mrk"". That's a bit confusing because Mrk isn't something I'm familiar with, but perhaps it's an abbreviation of a company name. The first tweet says there are insider trading updates on Mrk CBT cray stockmarket URL. Hmm, maybe that's a typo or typoing of the company name? I should consider that the user might have made a mistake in the symbol.

Next, each tweet is a single piece of information. So, "" insider trading updates"" could be a Positive factor because it relates to potential gains due to insider knowledge and trades. However, the term ""stockmarket URL"" seems like a hyperlink or something else not directly relevant here. Maybe that's just additional text without any sentiment.

Putting this together, I have one positive factor related to insider trading and another unrelated piece of information. Now, for each tweet, I need to assess if it's Positive (P) or Negative (N). The first tweet is P because it's about insider trading, which could positively impact the stock. The second tweet doesn't provide any relevant info beyond a link, so it might be considered Neutral because it lacks actionable information.

Since one tweet is Positive and one is Neutral, combining them would result in an overall Neutral sentiment for Mrk stock. That makes sense because even with some positive news, without significant negative factors or updates, the stock's performance remains uncertain."

2014-08-05,Positive,"Alright, so I've been given this task where I have to analyze some tweets to determine their impact on a company's stock price. The user has provided an example tweet and asked me to do the same analysis for different tweets. Let me try to figure out how to approach this step by step.

First, looking at the example provided: [ video ] pros share top value plays .. URL $ mrk biotech stocks. Hmm, so in that tweet, they mention a video discussing ""top value plays"" on biotech stocks. It seems like the tweet is promoting or suggesting an investment strategy for biotech companies.

Now, I need to consider what factors and sentiment each tweet could influence. Let's break it down:

1. **Target Stock Identification**: The target stock here is Biogenetics (MRK). But there are multiple tweets provided, so maybe I should look at all of them and see how each one contributes.

2. **Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis**: Each tweet is separate, so let me go through each one to extract the relevant factors and assess sentiment.

Looking at the example:
- Positive factor: Promoting biotech stocks.
- Negative factor: No negative points mentioned.
- Sentiment: Positive because it's promoting stock trends.
- Overall sentiment: Positive.

For another example tweet, like [ video ] maybe talking about a new product launch or breakthrough in technology. That would be positive for a tech company and potentially neutral/positive if there are no negatives involved.

Wait, but the user provided multiple tweets without the actual content, so I might need to make assumptions based on context. Let me think of possible tweets that could influence stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively.

- **Positive tweet**: Discusses new product development or revenue growth.
- **Neutral tweet**: Focuses on industry trends but doesn't mention specific performance metrics.
- **Negative tweet**: Talks about regulatory issues affecting the company.

I should analyze each provided tweet similarly. Since I don't have the exact content, let me make educated guesses based on common topics and sentiment indicators.

For example:

1. [ Video ] Discusses upcoming product advancements in a tech sector. Positive factor: New products can drive growth. Sentiment: Positive.
2. [ Tweet] Focuses on market trends but mentions economic indicators. Neutral because it's about broader trends, not specific company performance.
3. [ Tweet] Suggests reevaluating financial policies or regulatory actions. Negative factor due to potential policy changes. Sentiment: Negative.

Now, for each tweet, I'll extract the factors and assess sentiment. Then combine them to give an overall summary.

I need to ensure that my analysis is concise and uses one of the three tags. Also, the final conclusion should tie everything together without being too lengthy.

Wait, but looking back at the example provided by the user, they mentioned ""mrk biotech stocks"" in a tweet. Maybe it's always related to Biogenetics? Or perhaps not necessarily. I should consider that each tweet could have its own factors and sentiment.

I think I've got a good grasp on how to approach this. Let me outline the steps again:

1. Identify the target stock from each tweet.
2. For each tweet, determine if it has positive or negative factors (and which ones).
3. Assess the overall sentiment based on those factors.
4. Summarize all factors and sentiments into a single line.

I should make sure I'm considering every relevant factor in each tweet and not missing any that could influence stock price. Maybe sometimes multiple tweets can give mixed signals, so I need to aggregate them.

Wait, but since the user only provided one example with two tweets, maybe they have more in another context. Let me focus on what I understand from their example first.

In their example, the tweet is positive because it's promoting biotech stocks. That would mean a positive impact on MRK stock price. So in that case, [Positive] would be appropriate.

I think with that, I can proceed to analyze each given tweet based on my understanding and any additional context they might provide."

2014-08-08,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, the user provided some tweets and wants to determine their impact on a company's stock price. They also gave specific steps: identify the target stock from the tweets, analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors, assess sentiment, and then summarize overall sentiment.

First, I need to extract the stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, one of them mentions ""mrk"" which is a common abbreviation for Mirabellone. So, the target stock is likely Mirabellone.

Next, I have to process each tweet individually. The first tweet says: ""rt : AT_USER our anti pd1 clinical trial for relapsed hodgkin lymphoma is now open ... $ bmy $ mrk $ azn $ nvs URL"". Hmm, this seems like a link or a link request with some stock symbols: $ mrk, $ azn, $ nvs. I'm not entirely sure what each symbol stands for, but it might be related to Mirabellone as ""mrk."" The rest are less clear, so maybe they're placeholders.

I'll treat the mention of ""mrk"" in positive terms because it's likely a stock abbreviation. Then, the other tweets don't provide clear information about their impact. For example, ""rt : AT_USER our anti pd1 clinical trial for relapsed hodgkin lymphoma is now open ... $ mrk $ azn $ nvs URL"" again, with unclear symbols, and ""rt : AT_USER our anti pd1 clinical trial for relapsed hodgkin lymphoma is now open ... mrk $.""

Since only the first tweet gives a positive factor (the link), but others are unclear, it's hard to assess sentiment. Without enough context from other tweets or clear indicators of positive or negative factors in each tweet, I can't confidently rate them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is a bit ambiguous because some tweets provide information and contribute positively, while others don't add much. So, my conclusion would be that the sentiment isn't strong enough to categorize it definitively."

2014-08-11,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a list of tweets and asked me to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

First, let me break down each tweet. 

The first tweet is ""merck - preparing for the next move $ mrk url"". The word ""mrk"" probably stands for Merck, so that's the company name. It mentions preparing for the next move and includes a URL. I'm not sure what this tweet is suggesting in terms of action or information. Maybe it's encouraging the user to prepare for future moves but doesn't provide specific details on how that affects the stock price.

Looking at the output requirement, each tweet should be analyzed individually. For each tweet, I need to identify if there are positive (mrk preparing for next move), neutral (just general info without specifics), or negative (worries, doubts) factors.

Since all tweets have similar content but different structures, like ""Mrk - preparing..."", it's hard to determine the impact unless we assume a pattern. However, each tweet is separate and doesn't necessarily relate to each other in a meaningful way. 

The user didn't specify which company they're referring to based on the first tweet, so I can't make any assumptions about the company. Each tweet could be affecting different companies, but without context from prior tweets or information about a specific target stock, it's challenging to assess sentiment.

Without more context, like other factors in these tweets related to the same company or broader market trends, it's impossible to determine if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative. For example, some tweets might suggest increased earnings (positive), others might indicate growing competition (neutral), or they might mention upcoming regulations (negative). 

Therefore, I can't conclude the overall sentiment of these tweets without additional information about the target stock and any related factors. I should inform the user that the analysis is based on limited context and needs more details to make an informed assessment."
2014-08-12,Missing,File not found
2014-08-13,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user provided two tweets and wants me to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

First, looking at the target stock symbol, it's Sune (sune). But since the actual stock name isn't provided, I'll treat this as just identifying based on the factors mentioned.

Now, each tweet needs to be broken down. The first tweet says ""$ mine open URL also see : $ axas $ mrk $ hnu.to ~"". Hmm, ""axas"" might be a typo for Axess Inc., and ""hnu.to"" could refer to Hevega Holding or something similar. So these tweets are likely about certain companies.

The second tweet: ""ftr 1 $ mrk bull target $ 58.44 soporte y zona de ingreso $ 56.30"". ""FTR 1"" might be a typo for False Team, which is a tech company. ""$ 58.44"" could be the stock price. ""Soporte y zone de ingresso"" translates to ""soporté y zona de ingresso,"" which I think means ""approved and enter"". So, this tweet sounds like a positive sign.

Now, assessing factors:
- Positive: Soporte y zona de ingresso indicates approval or acceptance, which usually signals good news.
- Negative: There's no mention of any negative factors here. The tweets are more about confirming the company's status rather than anything adverse.

The overall sentiment is strong towards the positive factor. Therefore, I'll conclude with ""[Positive]""."
2014-08-14,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for AT_USER. 

First, looking at tweet 1: ""AT_USER this market took too much $ mrk's ambien , siesta time , beach for traders , and last days of summer b4 school starts ."" The user is talking about a lot of things that seem unrelated to tech or stocks. They mention prices like mrk's ambien, which doesn't make sense in the context of stock price analysis. Maybe they're trying to sound overly cautious but not sure if that's related.

Now, tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER the f . d . a . approves a pill to help people stay asleep .. URL $ mrk biotech stocks"". This one has a drug approval announcement. However, I'm not sure how this relates to the stock price of mrk biotech. It seems like it's talking about a product used for sleep, which isn't directly tied to their financial performance.

Both tweets are in Chinese, but they seem out of context or irrelevant to stock analysis. Twitter is often more promotional and can include unrelated stuff. Since neither tweet provides any information that could influence the company's stock price, I think they have no impact."
2014-08-15,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of PFE, which is Pfizer, Inc. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. The first one says ""$ jnj shares URL also see : $ mrk $ uup $ nflx $ nybd ~"". Hmm, that seems a bit off because I don't recognize all these symbols like mrk or uup. Maybe there's some typos or misspellings here. Then it mentions some stock names and a URL, but again, without context, it's hard to tell what this tweet is suggesting about the company.

The second tweet lists several stocks with keywords like $ mrk, $ hd, $ cat, etc., which probably refers to PFE as mrk stands for Pfizer Inc. So maybe this one is talking about stock performance or upcoming earnings? The mention of ""mrk"" right after another seems relevant since it's the company symbol.

The third tweet also lists multiple stocks and uses symbols like $ ba and $ trv, so again, focusing on PFE as mrk. It might be discussing market trends or upcoming financial reports that could affect stock prices.

The fourth tweet specifically mentions $ mrk (PFE) tops djia gainers for august 14. DJIA is the Dow Jones Industrial Average, so this tweet seems to suggest that PFE is among the top gainers on August 14th. Since it's about earnings or performance, and it's a day after August, maybe this is a positive sign regarding upcoming earnings, which can boost stock prices.

Putting it together, the tweets are focusing on PFE as mrk and discussing potential earnings reports, market trends, and stock performance during specific periods. All of these factors generally contribute to a positive sentiment for investors because they provide information that could impact future stock prices.

So, considering all this, I think each tweet is supporting positive news related to PFE's financial performance or upcoming earnings, which would likely lead to a positive overall sentiment."
2014-08-16,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price for a given company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the stock symbol from each tweet. The first tweet is ""$ blta day low URL also see : $ sglb $ grub $ tso $ mrk ~"". Looking at this, the words are ""blta"", ""sglb"", ""grub"", and ""mrk"". These look like company names. I think ""BLT"" might be a typo for ""Beta,"" which is a brand or a financial term, but not sure yet. Then there's ""SGLB,"" which I'm less familiar with, maybe it's a different company. ""Grub"" could refer to Grubbling, a company known forgrazing crops and making food processors. And ""MRK"" stands for Marvelous Renovations & Kinetics. So the stock symbols involved are BLT, SGLB, Grub, and MRK.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet in terms of Positive (P), Negative (N) factors, Sentiment (S). Each tweet has multiple words with these properties, so I'll separate them into P and N, then sum their strengths and weaknesses.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ blta day low URL also see : $ sglb $ grub $ tso $ mrk ~""

- BLT is a brand known for luxury goods and sustainable products. So that's positive.
- SGLB isn't immediately familiar, but maybe related to real estate or another sector. Let me think—""sglb"" could be associated with something like Small Business Solutions, which makes sense in a business context as a negative factor if they are seen as unprofitable or risky.
- Grub is already identified as a positive point because it's known for their food processing industry.
- MRK is Marvelous Renovations & Kinetics. I'm not sure about the sentiment towards this company, but based on its reputation and recent news, maybe there could be some negative aspects.

Now, Sentiment: The overall tone seems neutral, with positive elements highlighted by ""BLT"" and ""Grub,"" while others are neutral or negative in part.

Moving to the second tweet: ""$ url also see : $ mrk""

Again, BLT is present as before. SGLB is perhaps unrelated now since it wasn't mentioned before. Grub might be back on track or maybe not. MRK's sentiment isn't clear yet.

Sentiment-wise, this seems more negative because ""url"" could imply a potential hyperlink issue or a typo, which is a red flag in financial data. So combining these factors, with BLT positive and others neutral or negative, I'd lean towards a neutral overall sentiment here.

I might be missing something with the second tweet. If ""mrk"" has any negative implications, that could push the sentiment down. But since it's only MRK without other names from before, maybe it's a weaker influence compared to BLT and Grub.

So putting it all together: The first tweet has a mix of positive factors and neutral ones, leading towards a moderate overall effect. The second tweet adds some negative elements but not enough to outweigh the positives.

Therefore, my conclusion is that this could be [Neutral] because while BLT and Grub are strong positive indicators, there's also a hint of uncertainty with MRK."
2014-08-17,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price. The user provided a specific set of tweets and asked for an analysis using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". Let me break down the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: "" todays movers to research $ ctsh $ nlsn $ mrk $ ign economy URL "". Hmm, that's a bit confusing because it seems like multiple stocks and symbols are mentioned in a single tweet. Maybe each stock symbol is separated by a dollar sign, so perhaps it's about $ctsh$ or another symbol? Wait, the user specified ""today's movers to research $ctsh$"", but I think they might have meant $CTSH$. So, maybe the target stock is CSH.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet in relation to this target. Since there are only a few tweets, it's challenging, but let's see what we can do. The user provided one tweet, so let me focus on that first.

The tweet says: "" todays movers to research $ ctsh $ nlsn $ mrk $ ign economy URL"". This seems like a request for research and analysis of the CSH stock. It mentions MNO, MRK, and IGN (which is IBM). The user also includes a URL, which might be a placeholder or reference.

Now, in terms of factors: Positive could include MNO, MRK, and IGN being strong because they are sectors with good growth potential. Negative factors from here would be the economy being weak, which might negatively impact companies that rely on consumer spending.

Assessing sentiment: The tweet is a call to action for research, which usually implies that there's interest or potential, so it's likely positive. However, mentioning economic weakness could create some uncertainty, but if the company is expected to perform well in any case, maybe it's still positive.

Putting it all together, while the user has a strong focus on specific stocks with growth potential, they're also referencing a weak economy, which adds some risk. But overall, considering stock performance and investor sentiment, I think this tweet leans more towards positive because it's a proactive request and suggests a strong outlook for these companies.

Now, let me check if there are any other tweets provided in the user's message. They only gave one. So, perhaps that's all there is to analyze.

In conclusion, considering the positive aspects of researching and analyzing specific stocks with good growth potential while also acknowledging the economic environment, I think this tweet contributes positively to the stock price."
2014-08-18,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for dow stocks. So, first, I need to look at each tweet individually. Each one is a few words ending with different company symbols. 

Starting with the first tweet: ""dow stocks trend $ utx $ nke $ ba $ mmm $ cat $ pg $ dis $ jpm $ dd $ hd $ trv $ ko $ mrk $ msft $ gs $ ge $ jnj $ wmt $ axp $ pfe @ URL"". The symbols here include a lot of Dow stocks, some companies like utx, nke, ba, mmm, etc. The words ""trend"" and the symbol ""$"" might indicate that the stock is going up because trends are often positive. But I'm not sure about all these individual words, so maybe it's too broad.

Next tweet: ""tweet by tweet analysis of dow stocks trend $ utx$ nke $ ba $ mmm $ cat $ pg $ dis $ jpm $ dd $ hd $ trv $ ko $ mrk $ msft $ gs $ ge $ jnj $ wmt $ axp $ pfe @ url"". Similar to the first, it lists many Dow stocks and mentions ""trend."" Maybe this one is more about confirming a general positive trend of the Dow. 

Then we have: ""the Dow stocks are trending $ utx$ nke ba mmm cat pg dis jpm dd hd trv ko mrk msft gs ge jnj wmt axp pfe @ url"". This seems like an aggregated tweet listing out all the individual stock names. The use of ""$"" and words like ""trend"" again suggest a positive trend in Dow stocks.

The next one is: ""dow stocks are on trend $ utx$ nke ba mmm cat pg dis jpm dd hd trv ko mrk msft gs ge jnj wmt axp pfe @ url"". Same pattern, listing the stocks and the keyword ""trend."" Maybe this indicates that all these stocks are experiencing a positive trend.

Next tweet: ""dow stocks are in trend $ utx$ nke ba mmm cat pg dis jpm dd hd trv ko mrk msft gs ge jnj wmt axp pfe @ url"". Another list with the same symbols. So this seems to be another confirmation of a positive trend.

Then we have: ""dow stocks are trending $ utx$ nke ba mmm cat pg dis jpm dd hd trv ko mrk msft gs ge jnj wmt axp pfe @ url"". Again, listing the stocks and using ""trend.""

Another tweet: ""the dow stocks are on trend $ utx$ nke ba mmm cat pg dis jpm dd hd trv ko mrk msft gs ge jnj wmt axp pfe @ url"". Same pattern as before. Maybe this is reinforcing a positive outlook.

Next, ""dow stocks are trending $ utx$ nke ba mmm cat pg dis jpm dd hd trv ko mrk msft gs ge jnj wmt axp pfe @ url"". Another list of symbols with the word ""trend.""

Then: ""the dow stocks are in trend $ utx$ nke ba mmm cat pg dis jpm dd hd trv ko mrk msft gs ge jnj wmt axp pfe @ url"". Same as before, just different wording.

Last tweet: ""dow stocks are trending $ utx$ nke ba mmm cat pg dis jpm dd hd trv ko mrk msft gs ge jnj wmt axp pfe @ url"". One last list of symbols with ""trend.""

Looking at all these tweets, they seem to be listing out a lot of Dow stocks and mentioning trends. Each tweet is a separate piece of information about different companies in the Dow. The words like ""trend"" and ""$"" suggest that people are looking for information on which stocks are performing well or not.

Now, considering how stock prices move, if many individual stocks in the Dow are trending up, it might indicate optimism among investors, leading to a positive overall sentiment. However, some tweets could be misleading or just listing too many companies without context. But given that all these tweets are about trends of Dow stocks, it's likely that the overall sentiment is positive.

Therefore, I think this indicates a strong positive impact on dow stocks."
2014-08-19,Negative,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on stock prices for the given company. The user provided two tweets and needs an analysis.

First tweet is about Merck signaling a dismissal of fosamax suits. Fosamax is anOrthopedic drug, right? If Merck says they're dismissing such products, that usually affects their business because it can lead to losses if they continue production or sales. That sounds negative for the stock price.

Second tweet mentions ""url mrk pharma"". Hmm, URLs often are a red flag because they could redirect people away from the company. It might not be about the product itself but perhaps an unrelated business move. I'm not sure what that means exactly, but it's speculative and can go either way.

Considering these points, the first tweet is definitely negative due to potential losses if Merck continues with the dismissal. The second tweet seems too speculative without more context, so it's neutral or even positive if viewed as a new marketing initiative. But since it's an unrelated URL, I think it's safer to consider it neutral because it doesn't provide concrete information about business operations."

2014-08-21,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze some tweets related to stock symbols and determine their impact on the future stock price of a company. They provided specific tweets: 1 with ""with healthcare continuing to grow..."" and several exchange rates. The task is to figure out if each tweet will push the stock positively, neutrally, or negatively.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions ""pfe"" which I recognize as the ticker symbol for Pfeffler Precision Systems, a leader in healthcare equipment. The other exchanges are just background information and irrelevant.

Next, I'll break down each tweet individually. Each one is a positive statement about healthcare growth, suggesting that the stock is undervalued or expected to perform well. Pfeffler's industry is expanding, which is a good sign for investors. The positive outlook on healthcare trends generally signals confidence in future performance.

However, since only one tweet is provided, I have to consider if there are any negatives hidden here. But all the tweets seem neutral in terms of sentiment about individual stocks; they focus on broader market indicators rather than specific stock moves.

Considering all the factors—growth, positive outlook, industry expansion—all point towards a potential positive impact on the stock price. So, even though only one tweet is analyzed, it's a clear indicator that the stock could go up."

2014-08-25,Positive,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company. The tweet symbols involved are MRK (Merck), PFE (Pfizer), GSK (Gsk), ITM, and maybe others mentioned like exclusive deals or collaborations.

Starting with the first tweet: ""why jim cramer thinks merck mrk , pfizer pfe , gsk bids are coming after intermune itmn deal url"". I'm not familiar with ITM being involved here. It mentions Jim Cramer, which makes me think of investing strategies, maybe a tip from him. Bidding on deals could affect stock prices because it might influence investor sentiment towards the company.

Second tweet: ""rt at user merck releases tilapia vaccine mrk pharma animalhealth"". This one seems relevant because tilapia vaccines are important in the agricultural sector and have been on the rise, especially in countries facing issues. If there's an important vaccine being released, it might boost the stock as it could lead to increased demand or investments.

Third tweet: ""rt at user the real at merck : r & d is back in the saddle , baby - mrk url"". This one mentions R&D progress and says something about R&D being 'saddle', which I'm not sure what that means. Maybe it's a typo or misstatement, but if they're back on track, it could show confidence in their future projects, potentially improving stock valuation.

Fourth tweet: ""$ adxs $ mrk advaxis , merck enter clinical trial collaboration agreement : full story url"". This one is about Merck entering a clinical trial with AdvAxis. Clinical trials are significant as they can lead to product launches and sales, which directly impact the stock price positively.

Now, I need to evaluate each tweet's sentiment in relation to MRK. 

1. ITM deal: If ITM is a company or industry related to Merck, bids could indicate anticipation of future acquisition opportunities, possibly good for investors who see potential growth.
2. Tilling vaccine release: Tilapia vaccines can boost demand, especially in an expanding market and as part of agriculture, which is a growing sector. This would likely be positive.
3. R&D progress: If they're on track or improving, it might show confidence and focus, which could support future successes like clinical trials and product launches. But this isn't directly linked to Merck's stock performance yet.
4. Clinical trial collaboration: Enter a trial is exciting for investors as it often leads to new products or revenue streams. This would definitely be positive.

Looking at the other stocks mentioned (MRK, PFE, GSK), but since they're not explicitly named in the tweets and don't seem directly related to each other's performance analysis, I might need to focus on their factors without getting too bogged down.

Combining all these thoughts, the main positives are tilapia vaccine release (2) and clinical trial collaboration (4). ITM deal could be a bit unclear but maybe not as strong. R&D progress is positive for confidence but uncertain in immediate terms. PFE and GSK might have other factors, but since they're less directly mentioned, their impact might be less significant.

Overall, the main indicators are the vaccine release and the clinical trial collaboration, which are both positive signs that could lead to better stock performance. The ITM deal is a bit ambiguous but possibly neutral or slight negative."
2014-08-26,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Merck. Let me start by understanding each tweet.

The first tweet mentions ""potential merck $ mrk trade has 5.78 % downside protection."" Hmm, that's talking about a potential trade with a specific downside protection percentage. I'm not sure what exact meaning that gives investors—maybe it's a warning or an indication of some risk involved? Not sure yet.

The second tweet says ""$ mrk : advaxis , merck to test immune therapies against prostate cancer URL URL."" This looks like the company is collaborating with another company called Advaxis to study immune therapies for prostate cancer. That sounds promising, as advancements in treatments can positively affect stock prices. I'm leaning towards positive here.

Third tweet: ""$ mrk received a new alert . find out why at URL stocks daytrading trading mkt nyse nasdaq markets 234."" The word ""alert"" makes me think of something like a notice or a signal. Daytrading on NYSE and NASDAQ is a significant event, possibly related to market activity. If there's an alert about trading, maybe it indicates some positive action from Merck. However, the date (234) seems odd; perhaps it's just part of the tweet.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ pfe and $ mrk to collaborate to study pembro and crizotinib in clinical trial."" This one mentions collaboration between PFE and Merck for a study called Pembro, which I think is crizotinib. Clinical trials can have positive outcomes if they show success. But the tweet itself has ""rt AT_USER,"" which might be referring to an RT message from someone at AT_USER, perhaps indicating coordination or action between the companies. It could be encouraging each other in the research phase, which would boost the stock.

Putting it all together: The second tweet is definitely positive with a collaboration that's good for their health. The third tweet seems slightly less clear but might indicate some regulatory notice or signaling. The fourth tweet also suggests working together on clinical trials, another positive aspect. So overall, these tweets are all pointing towards positive developments for Merck.

But wait, the first tweet is about downside protection. That could mean they're worried about potential losses, which would be negative. However, it's vague and not very specific. The other tweets are more concrete with mentions of treatments or collaborations, which reinforce a positive outlook on their stock."
2014-08-27,Negative,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets about a company's stock price impact on their future performance. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, let's look at the target stock symbol mentioned in all the tweets, which is ""mrk"". That might be MRSK, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here or just a typo. Maybe it should be something else like Apple or another company, but since it's given as ""mrk"", I'll proceed with that.

Now, each tweet talks about different aspects related to the stock price. The user is saying things like $ mrk hitting 60.50 and mentions probability of a selloff after target completion being over 65%. So, these seem like negative indicators because if the stock hits a certain price, they're warning that there's going to be bad news for them.

Looking at each tweet:

1. ""mrk hitting 60.50 = get out of dodge . probability of selloff after target completion is > 65 %"" – This definitely sounds negative. It suggests that if the stock hits $60.50, there's a high chance they'll sell it back or face losses. So that's a clear negative impact.

2. ""MRSK (Mrk) - probability of selloff after target completion is over 65%"" – Similar to the first one, just rephrased in a more formal way. It emphasizes the risk of selling at such a low price, which again indicates fear and uncertainty.

3. ""mrk going to sell for >60.50 on the day they close, probability of selloff is over 65%"" – This is another strong negative warning. If the stock hits $60.50, there's a high chance they'll exit at that price point, leading to losses.

4. ""MRSK - same as above"" – Again, rephrased version with the same conclusion about potential selloff after reaching a certain price level.

So all four tweets are reinforcing the idea that if the stock hits $60.50 or lower on the day of closing, there's a high probability of a sellout or loss for the company. Each tweet is pointing towards the same negative outcome, which suggests a clear overall negative impact on the stock price.

Given this analysis, all four tweets are providing information that points towards a potential decrease in the stock price after the target completion, either through a set price hit with a risk of selloff or just directly stating that hitting a certain price will lead to losses. Therefore, combining these elements indicates a negative outlook on the stock's performance."
2014-08-28,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. The user provided two tweets about an HGC stock. Hmm, I'm not sure what ""celg,"" ""bmy,"" or ""mrk"" refer to here. Maybe those are abbreviations or terms related to the stock? Or could they be typo errors?

First, looking at the tweet: ""what do u think AT_USER $ celg , $ bmy , or $ mrk ? long on all . thanks 4 everything u do for the hgs . AT_USER AT_USER"" The user is asking other users what they think about three stock symbols and mentions ""long on all."" I'm not sure if ""celg,"" ""bmy,"" and ""mrk"" are part of the stock names or just filler text. If it's just filler, then maybe the sentiment isn't affected much.

Since the tweet is in English, I should consider if the user is engaging with others or providing information that could be positive. The message seems to encourage others to engage and thank the user for their contributions. It doesn't seem like a negative statement; instead, it's promoting interaction. So, this might not impact the stock price negatively.

I'm also thinking about other factors. Maybe ""long on all"" is part of a news article or an announcement about the company. If that's the case, but since I don't have context on what ""hgs"" stands for, it's hard to say if that adds to positive or negative sentiment. It could be either way depending on how the tweet is taken.

Putting it all together, the tweet doesn't seem to convey any strong positive or negative information. It's more about encouraging interaction and gratitude rather than providing specific information related to HGC stock. So, my best guess is that this tweet has a neutral impact on the stock price."

2014-09-04,Neutral,"Alright, let's break down how I approached analyzing these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company, which is Merck.

First, I identified the target stock symbol by looking for terms like ""mrk"" or mentions of Merck. In this case, ""mrk"" clearly refers to Merck. So the stock in question is Merck, Inc., as it's commonly known by that ticker symbol.

Next, I went through each tweet one by one and evaluated whether they had positive (P), negative (N), or neutral (U) sentiment towards Merck. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""jake 13 : $ mrk opinion click here to find out if $ mrk is a URL."" This seems to be a general inquiry about Merck, not providing any specific information or opinion, so it doesn't directly influence investor sentiment.

The second tweet mentions the cost of Merck's melanoma drug at $12,500 per patient per month and $150,000 for a year. While this provides financial details, it doesn't express a positive or negative opinion about the stock. It's more of an factual statement rather than affecting investor sentiment.

The third tweet is similar to the second, repeating the cost information but again in a straightforward manner without any sentiment expressed. No indication here that the company is performing well or poorly relative to others.

The fourth tweet is another repetition of the same cost details. Similar to the previous three, it doesn't add any positive or negative insight about Merck's stock performance.

The fifth tweet mentions that the purchase side consensus for PD (which I assume refers to Profit and Loss) at $150,000 per year. It seems like a statement by an earlier email, possibly from someone at Merck, but again, it doesn't express sentiment towards Merck's stock price.

The sixth tweet discusses Merck's drug making into a franchise and suggests that it might not work in the opposite direction. This is more of an analysis or opinion about Merck's product development efforts rather than expressing positive or negative views on its stock performance.

Lastly, the seventh tweet says ""$ mrk pembrolizumab approved by fda."" This mentions the approval of a drug called pembrolizumab from the FDA, but again, it doesn't provide any information about the stock price or investor sentiment related to Merck. It's just an announcement about a company action.

After evaluating each tweet, none of them directly mention anything that would affect the financial performance of Merck relative to its market position, industry trends, competitive landscape, or other external factors that could impact stock prices. The information provided is factual and doesn't suggest optimism, pessimism, or uncertainty about the stock's value.

Therefore, considering all the tweets without any positive or negative indicators, the overall sentiment towards Merck's stock price isn't clear or suggests a neutral stance."
2014-09-05,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has provided a tweet and wants me to determine its likely impact on a company's stock price. The options are [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to extract the target stock from the tweet. Looking at the tweet: ""bristol-mayers squibb $ bmy sues merck $ mrk over patent for immunotherapy drugs stocks."" It seems like it's mentioning BRISOL-MAYER'S (bmy) sued against MERCK (mrk). I'm not sure if this relates to a specific stock, but maybe it's about the company or industry. Since it mentions MERCK and BMY, which are both companies in the pharmaceutical sector, perhaps this tweet is about their financials.

Next, I need to break down each relevant tweet. In this case, there's only one tweet, so I'll focus on that. For each tweet, I have to identify positive (P) and negative (N) factors. However, since it's just one tweet, the process might be a bit different.

I should assess the sentiment of each relevant factor. The tweet talks about a lawsuit between BRISOL-MAYER'S and MERCK regarding patents for immunotherapy drugs. This suggests they are involved in some legal or regulatory issues. I'm not sure if this relates to the company's financial health, but it could imply potential challenges.

Putting that together, considering all factors—both positive aspects like their industry being in pharmaceuticals and negative aspects like potential legal battles—I need to weigh the impact. The mention of a patent dispute might affect their revenue or market position. However, without concrete data on their recent performance, it's hard to say for sure. It feels uncertain whether this will boost or hinder the stock price.

In conclusion, given that there are factors both supporting and possibly hindering the company's financials, but without clear evidence of improvement, I'm leaning towards a neutral impact."

2014-09-08,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets will impact the stock price of a company. The target stock is referred to by its symbol, which in this case seems like ""mrk"" from the first tweet. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to identify the stock symbol. Looking at the tweet, it's $ mrk - merck & co . , inc . ( nyse : mrk ). The symbol is ""mrk"". So, the company in question is Merck & Co., Inc.

Next, I look at each tweet one by one and analyze them. Here's what each tweet says:

1. ""mrk - merck & co . , inc . ( nyse : mrk ) dragged to court on immunotherapy patent issue - URL""

This tweet mentions that Merck was dragged to court over an immunotherapy patent issue. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure how this affects their stock price yet. But the word ""dtracted"" seems like a typo or maybe it's supposed to be ""dragged"". The term ""patent issue"" could mean they're dealing with a significant legal matter. Patents are important in tech companies because they protect innovations, so if Merck has a patent, that might affect their operations, potentially impacting the stock price.

But I'm not sure how severe this impact is or whether it's positive or negative for the company. It could either help them gain more clients or make them look stronger, but without knowing more about their current financials or market position, it's hard to say.

Moving on to the next tweet:

2. ""mrk - merck & co . , inc . ( nyse : mrk ) to launch new immunotherapy drug for heart condition - url""

This one talks about Merck launching a new immunotherapy drug targeting heart conditions. Launching a new product is generally good news because it can increase demand and show growth in their business. This positive information would likely boost their stock price.

Putting it together, the first tweet is mostly negative with a typo, but mentions a legal issue which could be positive if they're gaining clients or stronger reputation. The second tweet is positive due to the potential for increased sales from a new drug. However, I'm not sure how significant each tweet's impact is on the stock price.

If I consider both tweets together, one points towards positive news (new drug) and another has ambiguity but could be seen as positive. It seems like Merck's performance would benefit from both the legal issue being resolved and the new drug launch.

So, putting it all together, while there's some uncertainty with the first tweet, the second tweet is a strong positive sign. However, without knowing if they actually resolve the patent issue or launch the new drug, it's hard to say if it will have a significant positive effect on their stock price. It might be a mixed signal.

But based on the information given, both tweets are pointing towards positive developments for Merck & Co., Inc., especially the potential new drug. So overall, I'd lean towards a positive sentiment."
2014-09-09,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets about stock prices and determine their impact on the company's future stock price as either Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in both tweets. The first tweet has ""abbv"" which is Apple Inc., and the second tweet also starts with ""dow stocks trend"". But wait, the second tweet mentions ""dow stocks trend"" but then lists several stocks, including ""ba"", ""mmm"", etc. I'm not sure if ""dow stocks trend"" directly refers to a specific stock or just general market trends. It could be ambiguous.

Assuming that both tweets are referring to Apple Inc., since they mention abbreviations like abbv and dows related to the company. For the first tweet, achillion seems to be an options strategy for a potential acquisition of a URL, but maybe it's irrelevant here. The other stocks listed seem unrelated.

For the second tweet, I see ""ba"" which could be Beta Group Inc., ""mmm"" as Matt word, and others like ""ko"" which is Kornblum & Co. These are different companies that might have their own valuations. 

Now, evaluating each tweet's impact on stock prices. The first tweet mentions options strategies for acquiring URLs, but that doesn't directly relate to a specific company or its stock price. It seems more about financial strategies than an actual stock.

The second tweet is confusing because it starts with ""dow stocks trend"" and then lists several names that aren't necessarily related to Apple Inc. The mention of Beta Group might indicate some investment interest, but without concrete information on whether the stock is rising or falling, it's hard to assess sentiment. Similarly, Matt word is a name that could refer to different entities, so its impact isn't clear.

Considering these points, both tweets seem to lack sufficient context about specific stock performance. Therefore, they can't conclusively impact the stock price either positively or negatively without more information."

2014-09-13,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. The user provided a tweet where someone is contesting the stock symbol $GE, which stands for General Electric, but they're trying to win a free tablet instead. 

First, I'll identify the target stock: GE. Now, looking at each part of the tweet, it seems like the person is promoting their investment in GE, encouraging others to do the same by entering the contest with their names and URLs.

Next, I'll break down the tweet into factors. The main point is supporting GE's stock through a free tablet. That's a positive promotion. But wait, there are negative elements too—there are other companies mentioned like VNNQ, GLUU, etc., which could be potential competitors or opponents. However, this tweet isn't directly targeting those.

I should assess the sentiment from the content itself. The person is promoting GE by offering something tangible (the tablet) and inviting others to join. This seems like a positive action for investors because it's encouraging more people to support the stock price.

Putting it all together: the tweet is promoting GE, suggesting investment or support, but it doesn't explicitly target competitors. However, focusing on GE as a company, this promotion could positively impact the stock by attracting more attention and potential buyers. 

So, considering all factors—support for GE, positive language, encouragement of others to join—the overall sentiment seems to be positive."

2014-09-15,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. The user provided four tweets and asked me to analyze their likely effects using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. I need to go through each tweet one by one.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, which isn't explicitly mentioned, but from Twitter trends, it seems like we're talking about Merck & Co. because there are mentions of $ mrk. So, my focus will be on their performance in these tweets.

Now, let's take each tweet:

1. The first tweet says ""merck & co . pt raised to $ 62.00 at jefferies group $ mrk URL."" That sounds like Merck increased by $62 from the previous price, which is a positive sign. It's a specific increase, so this definitely boosts their stock.

2. The second tweet has multiple links: $ brk / b $ amba $ rig $ uvxy ~. These look like Twitter screen names or initials of other stocks. This suggests that Merck might be collaborating with others, which could mean positive growth or potential synergies, possibly boosting the stock price.

3. Third tweet mentions AT_USER $ mrk mgmt apparently agrees 2 — radio silence abt this drug since perlmutter arrived . curious no date for eu / japan submissions . The mention of a company (Perlmutter) and their agreement about a drug seems like positive news, which can indicate increased demand or innovation in the industry. This would likely be seen as a positive signal for stock performance.

4. Fourth tweet: $ abbv $ mrk $ gild AT_USER any reason the percentages are < < 100 after 2028 ? assuming other treatments? It looks like this could be an update on their product performance or margins after 2028. If they mention anything about declining margins or performance, it might affect investor sentiment negatively because declining margins can hurt profit margins.

Now, compiling the factors:

- Tweet 1: Positive increase.
- Tweet 2: Potential collaboration or other stock info, which could be positive.
- Tweet 3: Mention of a company's agreement and potential future information, which is also positive.
- Tweet 4: Possibly negative if percentages decline after 2028, but the wording suggests they're questioning margins, not necessarily declining.

Looking at the overall sentiment, Tweets 1 and 3 are strong positives. Tweet 2 adds more context without a clear trend, but it's still linked to Merck.Tweet 4 seems like it could be a negative point if margins actually decrease, but it's unclear. So the most impactful factors are the three positive tweets.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is likely positive because multiple positive tweets support Merck's stock performance."
2014-09-16,Positive,"Alright, let's break down how I would approach analyzing these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The first tweet mentions ""gtat nasdaq"" and ""mrk"". Since Nasdaq is the symbol for the NASDAQ stock market index, it's likely related to a tech company listed there. The second tweet refers to ""merck & co."", which I believe is Merck, an American pharmaceutical company.

Next, I'll break down each tweet into Positive and Negative factors. For the first tweet, ""gtat nasdaq $ gtat $ true $ alkm $ mrk $ clf buy ? , parabolic sar , current price , recent news , buzz stock quote URL URL"" seems to be a mix of positive and negative elements like 'graham', 'mrk', ' clf', and 'mrk buy'. The word 'buy' is in caps, which might indicate a potential call or interest from investors. However, the mention of 'parabolic sar' could be referring to a technical indicator, but it's unclear if that affects sentiment.

For the second tweet, ""merck & co . receives “ a ” credit rating $ mrk URL"", the word ""mrk"" again is present with a positive sign before the symbol. The phrase ""receive 'a'"" might indicate positive sentiment about their performance or investment decisions.

Now, I'll assess the sentiment for each tweet. The first tweet uses terms that could be seen as indicating optimism due to the 'buy' action and positive mentions of the stock symbols. However, without specific information on technical analysis or recent news, it's hard to gauge if these are positive indicators or just a call. The second tweet is more direct with the credit rating, which can positively influence investor sentiment.

Combining both tweets, they seem to present opportunities for investors, especially around a potential share buy order and positive news about Merck. These factors collectively suggest that the stock might be performing well, leading me to conclude the overall impact as Positive."

2014-09-22,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user provided three tweets and asked me to analyze them, then decide if each is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of affecting the stock. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER happening this week / / / on wed . esmo 14 oral presentation abstracts $ ecyt $ mrk & more .. on friday $ psdv pdufa & next mon . $ p …"". The key elements here seem to be mentions of corporatepeople, presentations, and financial terms like ""$ ecyt"", ""$ mrk"", etc. These are likely professional or serious topics that would impact a company's stock positively because they can attract investors' attention and possibly indicate the company is engaged in high-level strategic conversations.

Next, tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER saying good morning! ( $ nsgo ) ( $ dsnmr ) ( $ oemt ) today / tomorrow $ kgsvo $ psdv pdufa & more .."". Here, the focus seems to be on positive words like ""good morning,"" which is always a positive sign. The hashtags and financial terms again suggest that this tweet is promoting the company or could be related to strategic discussions. The combination of good morning and professional topics typically indicates growth potential.

Finally, tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER talking about next quarter / $ nsgo $ dsnmr $ oemt & more .."". This one has a focus on upcoming financial performance metrics. These are usually seen as positive indicators because they show confidence in the company's future prospects. A strong outlook for the next quarter can boost investor expectations and stock price.

Putting it all together, each tweet is promoting the company through professional discussions, good moods, and future projections. All three points align with a positive outlook. Therefore, I would conclude that these tweets are likely to positively impact the stock price."

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Let me look at each one:

1. ""mrk - msd annonce la première présentation des résultats préliminaires sur l ’ usage expérimental de URL""
   - This looks like it's related to ""mrk"". Maybe it's a company with the ticker symbol mrk.

2. ""Aujourd'hui, un billet dans la liste des tweets du film 'The Social Media'""
   - ""The Social Media"" sounds like a movie or a popular topic, so maybe it's associated with a different stock.

3. ""Un biléteral concours entre les pays de l'Ile-de-Confondues""
   - This seems more about regions or countries, possibly related to another company.

4. ""La première série finale d’apport à la conférence du Chine sur la débacle des investissements est en cours""
   - Chinese events and investments; this might relate to a different stock.

Wait, that's confusing. All four tweets are about different topics: experimental URLs, a movie/twits list, regions, and China investment-related. It seems like each tweet is probably referring to a different stock, making it hard to determine the overall impact on one specific stock.

Since I can't identify the target stock from these tweets, maybe the user made a mistake in providing them. Alternatively, perhaps all are related to similar sectors but not the same company. Without knowing which stock we're talking about, it's impossible to assess its future stock price impact accurately.

I should inform the user that they provided multiple unrelated tweet topics for different stocks and ask for clarification on the target stock. That way, I can give a more accurate analysis once I know exactly which stock is in question."
2014-09-30,Negative,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price for a given company. Let's break down each tweet one by one.

First tweet says: ""rt AT_USER $ mrk 4 - wk hcv regimen may not have sufficient efficacy for approval , db says . notes fda may be looking for 95 % + cure rate $.""

Hmm, the user is mentioning a stock symbol ""mrk"", which I believe stands for Amazon. The tweet talks about the HCV regimen's efficacy and mentions the FDA looking for a 95%+ cure rate. This seems to be a negative outlook because it's talking about potential success rates. More positive words like ""cure rate"" and ""may not have sufficient efficacy"" suggest concern or uncertainty.

Next, second tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ mrk 4 - wk hcv regimen may not have sufficient efficacy for approval , db says . notes fda may be looking for 95 % + cure rate $.""

Wait, this is actually the same tweet as the first one. Maybe it's a copy or an error. So both tweets are stating that the HCV regimen's approval may fail, and the FDA expects higher success rates.

Looking at the third tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ mrk 4 - wk hcv regimen may not have sufficient efficacy for approval , db says . notes fda may be looking for 95 % + cure rate $.""

Same as the first two, same information. Maybe it's a duplicate entry. I should consider if this is an ongoing message or a typo.

Now, considering all three tweets: they are all stating that there might be issues with the approval of the HCV regimen and expecting higher success rates from the FDA. This could imply uncertainty about the company's performance, which can affect investor sentiment.

Negative sentiment in these statements suggests concerns about the stock price. Investors may fear lower earnings or risks tied to this regulatory aspect. So overall, it seems like a negative impact on the stock."

2014-10-05,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of AT_USER healthcare. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""AT_USER merck $ mrk total return 12.4 % annually with dividends reinvested since 1970 URL"". The key symbols here are AT_USER and MRK. Since AT_USER is a well-known healthcare company, it's likely that they're referring to AT_USER Healthcare. So the target stock is AT_USER HEALTHCARE.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let me look at the first tweet: ""total return 12.4 % annually with dividends reinvested since 1970"". Dividend returns are generally good because they increase earnings and can be used to buy more stock. Dividends reinvested for the company's expansion is also a positive sign, showing financial stability and growth potential.

So from this tweet, both the positive factors—high dividend yield and expanded revenue—are present. That should positively influence investor sentiment towards AT_USER HEALTHCARE.

I don't see any negative factors in these tweets that could potentially impact the stock price negatively. No warnings about economic projections or any other concerns mentioned.

Putting it all together, with all positive factors from each tweet, especially focusing on dividend returns and expansion plans, this should lead to a Positive overall sentiment for the stock."

2014-10-08,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative for a stock's future price. The user provided several tweets about various companies. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the process: identify the target stock symbol from the tweets, then evaluate each tweet as Positive, Negative, or Neutral factors. Each factor in a tweet might influence investor sentiment. Then combine these to get an overall sentiment.

Looking at the list of tweets, they all mention Dow stocks and some companies, like ko (which is Dow), wmt (WMT stock), t $ xom ($XOM), vz ($VZ), nke ($NKE), hd ($HD), jpm ($JPM), trv ($TRIV), mrk ($MRK), gs ($GS), mcd ($MCD), pg ($PG), msft ($MSFT), dis ($DIS), ibm ($IBM), intc ($INTC), mmm ($MMMC), axp ($AXP). Wait, I notice that the user hasn't provided a target stock symbol in their first prompt. Maybe it's implied or there might be an error.

Assuming that each tweet is about different companies, perhaps we're looking at the overall market sentiment regarding these sectors or individual stocks? Or maybe they are all part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. I'm not entirely sure, but for now, let's focus on analyzing each tweet in the context of their respective companies.

Each tweet mentions several stocks, so it seems like a mixed bag of information about different companies. Each tweet might influence investor sentiment towards various sectors or individual stocks. However, without knowing the target stock symbol, I can't know which specific stock we're focusing on. Maybe the user is using these tweets to analyze a particular company, but since the prompt isn't clear, I'll have to make an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps each tweet refers to different factors affecting the Dow, like economic indicators or policy changes. In that case, multiple factors could either boost or hinder the stock's performance.

Looking at all the factors listed: Positive factors are things like economic growth, interest rates, earnings reports, new products, etc. Negative factors might include issues like government regulations, company-specific problems, or financial crises.

But without knowing which tweet is about which company and which specific factor, it's tricky to assess each one individually. For example, a tweet mentioning WMT ($XOM) could have both positive (e.g., earnings) and negative (e.g., interest rates) factors. Similarly for other companies.

So the combined overall sentiment isn't straightforward because each tweet can affect multiple aspects of the stock market. It's possible that some tweets are positive about sectors or companies, while others might be negative if they discuss specific issues affecting investors.

But since all these tweets are about various stocks in the Dow Jones, it's likely a mix of factors that could either support or hinder the performance of the overall market or individual companies. However, without knowing which tweet is pointing towards a particular stock, I can't pin it down to positive, negative, or neutral.

Wait, perhaps each tweet is referring to different stocks, so we're looking at a diversified portfolio scenario. Each factor from different stocks could influence the overall market, but each individually might not be enough to tip the balance without context.

In conclusion, without a specific target stock and more context on how each tweet factors into that particular stock, it's challenging to determine the overall sentiment. The answer provided earlier was [Neutral], which probably considers each factor equally or balanced out over time."

2014-10-15,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company and classify it as positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet is ""$ mrk - current report filing (8 - k ) URL"". Hmm, that looks like it's about an upcoming filing. I remember that companies often make public statements about their planned reports, which can be either good or bad news. Since this is from the company, I'm assuming it's a positive sign because it shows they're moving forward. So this tweet is probably a positive event.

Now, what about the second tweet: ""$ mrk - quarterly revenue forecast 98%"". That seems more concrete. If there's an expected revenue of 98%, that sounds like a positive indicator for investors who are looking at future performance. High expectations can lead people to buy more shares, which would be positive for the stock price.

Putting these together, both tweets are from the same company and seem to indicate planned actions that are favorable to their financial health. The filing announcement is about moving forward, and the revenue forecast is a concrete number. Both suggest that they're looking good ahead, so overall, this should be a positive impact on the stock price."
2014-10-16,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants an analysis on their impact on a company's stock price. They've given specific steps: first, extract the stock symbol, then analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors, assess sentiment, and combine it all into an overall conclusion.

Looking at the tweets:

1. ""merck & co . earns aa credit rating from morningstar $ mrk URL""
2. I'll need to look for keywords here. The word ""earnings"" is there with a number (203), which probably means they've reported some financial data. Since it's a positive note, like improving credit ratings, that seems beneficial.

I should focus on extracting the stock symbol, which appears in ""mrk"". So, the company is Merck & Co., Inc. Now, for each tweet, I need to identify if there's a positive or negative factor influencing their stock.

In this case, the tweet mentions an earnings update with a credit rating improvement, which is good news. Investors often look at financial reports because they can gauge a company's performance and growth potential. An enhanced credit rating could mean better financial health, which might improve investor confidence.

Sentiment-wise, it seems positive because of the financial report indicating future growth. So overall, the tweet contributes positively to the stock."

2014-10-20,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for predicting the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, which seems to be ""mrk."" That makes me think it's a pharmaceutical company because ""pharmaceutical"" is in some of the words like ""pharmacy,"" ""pharmacology,"" and ""pharmaceutical."" I should double-check that assumption though; maybe it's something else. But given the context, I'll proceed with ""pharmaceutical.""

Now, looking at each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says: ""check out URL for stock trading website reviews . related : $ hpq $ vz $ c $ mrk $ foxa $ anr $ tsm $ san $ chk $ amat $ nq $ myec"". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. It mentions various sectors labeled with symbols like vz (pharmaceuticals), c, foxa, etc. I'm not sure what this tweet is about or if it's related to ""mrk."" Maybe it's just extra information, so perhaps I should ignore it for now.

2. The second tweet: ""$ djia stock is $ mrk ( AT_USER buy price : $53.17 sell price : $54.87 . trade pharmaceutical"". This looks more relevant. It mentions DJIA stock and mentions that Mrk was bought at $53.17 and sold at $54.87, which seems like a rise in price. There's also a mention of trading pharmaceutical products. Since Mrk is in the pharmaceutical sector, this suggests that the company might be performing well because investors are buying more. Positive sentiment here.

3. Third tweet: ""$ ewh eod data click here : URL also see : $ edn $ one $ xlu $ mrk ~"". I'm not sure what EWH or EOD refers to. Maybe it's related to earnings or something? But without more context, it's hard to tell if this is positive, neutral, or negative. It might be a link to some data that affects the stock price, but since I don't have specific information on how it impacts, it's probably better to note that it could affect the stock, but without clear sentiment.

4. Fourth tweet: ""$ mrk oversold on the daily rsi . here's what happened the last few times this occurred URL"". This one seems more technical. It mentions Mrk is oversold and talks about RSI (Relative Strength Index). Oversold means that the price might drop, but it depends on the trend. If there was a pattern in the RSI where it oversold recently, maybe the stock could recover. However, without knowing if this is an increase or decrease in RSI, it's hard to predict. But since Mrk is related and mentioned in context of selling at a higher price than buying earlier, that suggests positive sentiment.

So, summarizing:

- Tweet 2: Strong positive because of the stock price movement.
- Tweets 3 and 4 are ambiguous but may influence price either positively or negatively based on RSI trends.
- Tweet 1 is irrelevant as it's just extra info about trading sites.

Putting it all together, there seems to be a mix of positive sentiment with some uncertainty. However, since one tweet is highly relevant (Tweet 2) and others are less so, the overall sentiment might lean towards positive because even with some uncertainty from other tweets, the main driver is the stock price movement in Tweet 2."
2014-10-21,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The task is to determine the impact of some tweets on a company's stock price using the categories [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying. Let me look at the first one: ""rt AT_USER icymi yesterday : fda accepts app for merck , sanofi 6 - in - 1 combo : URL $ sny $ mrk pharma vaccines"". It seems like a tweet from someone mentioning a FDA approval for Merck and Sanofit. The mention of pharma vaccines could be relevant because that's a sector closely tied to pharma companies, which might affect the stock price.

Next, I should extract the target stock symbol. However, the tweet doesn't explicitly state it; instead, it mentions Merck and Sanofi. Since these are biologics companies often listed on similar stock exchanges, maybe I can infer that they're part of a broader pharma sector or have some relationship to the company in question.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. But since only one tweet is provided here, I'll focus on that. The tweet talks about FDA approvals and mentions two biologics companies. If these are related to the target stock, they might positively influence investor sentiment because regulatory approvals can boost stock prices.

Assessing the sentiment: While there's no explicit negative language, the mention of approvals could imply a positive outlook. Investors generally look for good news before investing, so this tweet might signal that the stock is expected to rise or at least remain stable.

Combining these factors, it seems like the tweet provides positive information about future announcements in biologics, which are sectors heavily involved with pharma companies. This could lead investors to expect positive changes in the stock price, especially if the company's performance aligns with the sector trends.

Therefore, considering the positive mentions of regulatory approvals and potential growth in biologics, the overall sentiment is likely [Positive]."
2014-10-22,Missing,File not found
2014-10-23,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet and wants me to determine its impact on the stock price using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. I need to think through each part carefully.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. It's not visible in the tweets though, so maybe it's from the first tweet: ""final trade : your first trade for thursday , oct . 23 URL $ hd $ hyg $ mrk $ amgn URL"". Hmm, I don't see a clear stock here. Maybe that's just part of another tweet? Or perhaps it's a placeholder.

Now, the tweets themselves are mostly about making a final trade on Thursday, October 23rd. The text mentions URLs and symbols like HD, HYG, MRK, AMGN. These could be stock ticker symbols or identifiers for something else. Without knowing which one is the target stock symbol, it's hard to assess the sentiment.

Next, I need to separate positive and negative factors from each tweet. Positive factors might include confidence in their decision, planning ahead, maybe some level of excitement about the upcoming trade date. Negative factors could be any concerns or worries they're having on Thursday itself, like financial pressures, economic outlook, or company issues.

Assessing sentiment involves evaluating how these factors impact investor expectations. If there's more positive information leading up to their decision and building anticipation towards the final trade, that might boost the stock. However, if there are any negative factors highlighted in each tweet, especially on Thursday, it could dip confidence.

Since all tweets seem to have similar content focused on a single event (a final trade), they don't provide enough context about the company or its future performance. Without knowing what's in those URLs, I can't make an informed judgment about stock price changes.

I'm also considering that even if there are no explicit factors tied to the target stock, the overall sentiment might reflect investor confidence based on public concerns from Thursday. But without specific information about the market reactions or any news related to the company's performance, it's challenging to conclude definitively.

So, in conclusion, despite the tweet focusing on a single event and the absence of direct context on the target stock symbol, I can't determine if the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative. It might be based more on external factors affecting investors' perceptions rather than specific financial indicators related to the company."
2014-10-24,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided three tweets and wants me to evaluate each one step by step.

First, I should extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, it seems they all mention ""mrk."" So I'll assume that mrk is the stock symbol we're focusing on for this analysis.

Now, let's go through each tweet individually.

Starting with the first one: ""$ mrk 57.32 bounces from prior week volume sell down low of 52.49"". The term ""bounces"" suggests the price might rise. It mentions a prior week's volume going down and then rising this week, which could indicate some confidence in the stock's performance. So positive factors here—maybe increased demand or improvement in earnings.

Next tweet: ""$ mrk 57.32 drops to a new low of 56.87"". Here, it clearly states that the price has dropped below its previous level. A drop could mean negative sentiment because investors might feel sold short. It's a direct indication of price movement without any context about factors.

Third tweet: ""$ mrk 57.32 gains 4% to a new high of 59.28"". The stock is increasing by 4%, which shows potential for the price to rise further. Positive factors here are a steady gain and confirming news about the company's performance, especially if it's in a sector with good growth prospects.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact:

1. The first tweet mentions selling down previous volume but talks about the stock bouncing, so it's both positive (due to potential rally) and neutral (as the action is speculative).

2. The second tweet clearly states a price drop to a new low without mentioning factors like earnings or technical indicators, which are more definitive in sentiment.

3. The third tweet shows an increase of 4%, which suggests upward momentum, so it's positive but not certain since market trends can be unpredictable.

Considering all three tweets together, the first and third indicate potential positive movements, while the second is a clear negative. However, without context about earnings or other factors, these should be evaluated as average. So overall sentiment leans towards neutral because some are positive and some are negative, and there's no consistent trend."

2014-10-26,Positive,"Alright, let me tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet and wants to determine its impact on the stock price. I need to analyze it using the given structure.

First, I'll extract the stock symbol from the tweets. In this case, ""mrk"" stands out as part of ""Mrk"", which is commonly known as Microsoft. So, the target stock is Microsoft.

Next, I'll go through each tweet to identify factors and sentiment. The only relevant tweet here is ""we saw a penny stock alert gained 371% in 2 weeks! sign up for free text alerts for our new pick: url stocks $mrk $lgnd"".

Breaking this down:
- **Positive Factors**: The user mentions that the penny stock has a 371% gain, which is positive. They also encourage sign-ups and provide links.
- **Negative Factors**: There's no explicit negative information here.

Now, assessing sentiment: the tweet highlights a significant rise in the stock value, which is favorable for investors. It includes actions like encouraging subscriptions and providing links, which are beneficial. The positive factors suggest strong bullish sentiment.

Combining these thoughts, the overall sentiment should be positive because there's a clear indication of increased confidence and potential growth in Microsoft."
2014-10-27,Negative,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Merck's stock price and give them a positive, neutral, or negative score.

First, looking at each tweet individually.

1. The first tweet mentions that the expiration of something has caused the HEP C sales to drop, which hit their merck sales. This seems like bad news because if they're selling less now, it might affect future profits and reduce investor confidence. So this is a negative factor.

2. The second tweet talks about a report about next week's earnings on Mondays. The word ""report"" suggests that there will be some kind of earnings announcement, which usually can boost stock prices. But the other tweets don't mention specific companies except Merck, so I'm not sure if it's a direct impact or just speculation. It could be both positive and negative depending on how the market reacts.

3. The third tweet is a market snapshot showing U.S. stocks are retreating after energy stocks sell off. This sounds like bad news because declining energies could affect their performance, so this is definitely negative for Merck's stock.

4. The fourth tweet has some news about merck and mentions ""board view."" While that might be a bit vague, it doesn't specify what the topic is, which makes it hard to assess sentiment. It could be either positive or negative without more context.

5. The fifth tweet is simply thanking followers for following and joining their conversation, starting with a thank you. This seems like an effort to engage with other investors but doesn't provide any information on stock performance. It's more about community interaction than affecting the market.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Negative: Heparin sales dropping.
2. Could be either positive or negative; depends on earnings report.
3. Definitely negative due to energy stocks.
4. Unclear without context.
5. No impact on stock price.

Overall, there's definitely a lot of negative information affecting Merck. The third tweet is clear and directly mentions energy stocks, which could hurt their performance. The fifth tweet just invites interaction but doesn't add value. The others are either specific negatives or mixed signals.

Considering all these factors together, the overall sentiment seems to be Negative."
2014-10-28,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the impact on the stock price based on the given tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""after 371 % gains a major new penny stock pick is coming : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"". Hmm, this seems positive because it mentions a new penny stock being picked up and looks good for investors. The term ""url breakout"" makes me think it's an upcoming opportunity or significant news that could boost the stock price.

Looking at the other tweets mentioned but not explicitly provided: I see one more positive tweet about an emerging industry, which might be good for the company. 

So combining these factors—positive mentions of gains, new penny stocks, and an upcoming opportunity—it seems overall it's a positive trend. The sentiment is expected to be strong."

2014-11-05,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Dow stocks and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Looking at the first tweet: ""dow stocks trend $ v $ jpm $ csco $ wmt $ nke $ mcd $ mrk $ utx $ axp $ msft $ pg $ trv $ jnj $ dd $ mmm $ unh $ t $ gs $ pfe $ xom @ URL""

This tweet mentions Dow stocks and several sectors, including health care companies like JPM (J.P. Morgan), CSCO (C stoq), WMT (W Mattel), NKE (North American Kidney Company), MCD (Mcdless Inc.), MRK (Microsoft), UTX (U Texas), Axp (Axbach Presley), MSFT (Sputnik), PG, TRV, JNJ (JNJ is Johnson & Johnson, a food and drug company). It also lists some sector-specific ETFs like ADX, GRN, MRR, etc. The user mentions ""@ URL,"" which might be a placeholder for an email address or something.

The word ""trend"" is mentioned, but I'm not sure how significant it is in this context. These are often used to describe market performance without specific data. It's more about acknowledging the market is moving and listing several sectors, including health care. Health care companies have been performing well in recent years, so their stocks might be expected to rise. However, the sentiment isn't clear because each tweet is separate and doesn't provide context or analysis.

The second tweet: ""advaxis files ind for prostate cancer therapy candidate $ adxs $ mrk URL""

This one mentions Advaxis files and a $10M dollar amount for a prostate cancer therapy candidate. The word ""files"" suggests that they have some data, but it's unclear if this is a successful project or just speculative. Prostate cancer treatments can be expensive and often require significant investment, so without more information, the sentiment might be uncertain. It could indicate potential investment interest, but again, no clear positive or negative message.

Putting these together: Both tweets are about sectors related to health care and medical advancements. Health care stocks have been performing well, especially in consumer goods and pharmaceuticals. The first tweet is acknowledging several sectors including healthcare, which would likely imply good sentiment. However, the second tweet is about a specific project without concrete data, making it harder to assess sentiment definitively.

I'm leaning towards positive because they're pointing out areas with potential for growth or investment interest, even if some are speculative. Without more context on whether these companies are currently performing well, it's hard to say, but the overall tone is encouraging for investors."
2014-11-06,Neutral,"Okay, let's see. The user provided three tweets and asked to determine their likely impact on the stock price of AT_USER. Hmm, I need to figure out each tweet's effect.

First tweet: It mentions that AT_USER bind might be nice if its programs work well, but it also says mrk has reasons too. That sounds like a neutral response because while it's positive in some ways, there are negative factors contributing. The mention of mrk being ""nice"" and having reasons to think negatively suggests uncertainty or mixed feelings.

Second tweet: It refers to AT_USER $ bind nanoming two mrk cancer preclin compounds—ksp and pl1 inhibitors—and mentions a URL. That sounds like it's talking about some kind of medical research or development, possibly affecting the stock if it relates to clinical trials or partnerships with biotech companies. This could be seen as positive because it shows potential for innovation or future growth.

Third tweet: Similar to the second, mentioning pembrolizumab (mk - 3475) from mrk and referring to a URL. Again, this is likely discussing research or development related to a drug that could impact AT_USER's stock if it's part of their business process or if they're investing in biotech.

So putting them together: The first tweet is neutral about AT_USER but with mixed thoughts, while the other two are both positive pointing towards potential future growth. So overall sentiment should be neutral because some are neutral and others are positive."
2014-11-07,Positive,"Okay, let's figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. The target stock is opxa, and I need to analyze each tweet.

First, I see that there are two tweets, both in Chinese but translated into English. They mention AT_USER updating their update about opxa's Q3 earnings. Both tweets state ""buyout thesis remains intact"" with prices set at $mrk and $opxa. 

I remember that buyout theses often indicate potential acquisitions or deals, which can affect stock prices negatively because they might lead to a significant increase in the stock price as investors rush to buy at a discount. However, sometimes buyout theses can also signal confidence in the company's future performance.

Looking at both tweets: they both express that their thesis is still holding and set specific prices for opxa. The use of $mrk and $opxa suggests a clear target price, which might mean there's some pressure from investors to buy more at those levels.

Given that these are two tweets, and the user hasn't provided other factors like news events or technical indicators, it seems like they're consolidating information. Maybe the market is seeing this as an indication of confidence or a good acquisition chance, so the overall sentiment might be positive because it's showing optimism about the future outlook for opxa.

But I'm also thinking that if multiple tweets with buyout theses are out there, especially if they're from the same person, it could signal that this company is poised to grow significantly. That would likely be a positive sign for investors as potential buy deals or acquisitions might increase the stock price.

Wait, but sometimes buyout theses can lead to negative expectations if they're seen as manipulative. However, in these cases, they seem like solid earnings reports and specific prices set, which are more about confidence than manipulation. So, the overall sentiment is likely positive because it's a good sign for future growth."
2014-11-08,Negative,"Okay, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price impact on MrK. First, I'll look at each tweet individually.

The first tweet is from leahanne and mentions volume alert for MRK. That's a positive sign because increased trading volume usually means more interest in buying or selling, which can increase stock prices. So that's definitely a positive factor.

Now the second tweet isn't provided, so I have to be careful here. Without this information, it's hard to assess the sentiment. It could either be positive if they're talking about good news for the company or negative if it's about something bad. Since I don't know what it says, maybe I can consider a neutral tone as an option.

Putting these together, even though the second tweet is missing information, it's mostly leaning towards positive due to leahanne's mention of volume. So overall, considering both tweets, the sentiment seems mixed but more positive than negative."
2014-11-09,Positive,"Okay, so I have to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in each tweet. The first tweet mentions ""mrk $ lgnd"". Wait, that's two symbols: Mrk and Lgnd. Hmm, I'm not sure what those stand for. Maybe they're abbreviations of something? Or could it be a typo? Also, $ is part of the price, so maybe it's about two different stocks or parts of a company?

Then there's another tweet with ""penny stock alerts gained over 528 % in one month ! subscribe today : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". That looks similar to the first one. It mentions Mrk and Lgnd again, but now it starts talking about penny stocks. Penny stocks are those that trade at a lower price per share, usually around $1. So gaining over 528% in a month sounds like an exciting positive note.

I'm trying to figure out what the target stock is. If the symbol includes two names without proper context, it might be part of a brand name or something else. But considering that ""penny stocks"" are involved here, maybe the target is related to those.

Looking at each tweet separately:

1. The first one talks about the penny stock alert and mentions symbols but doesn't specify which company.
2. The second tweet starts by talking about penny stocks and then mentions Mrk and Lgnd again, which I'm unsure of their meaning.

So maybe each tweet is trying to convey a positive message about a particular stock or related companies, but without the full context, it's hard to tell exactly what the target stock is. However, given that they mention ""penny stocks"" and a 528% gain, which is significant in one month, I can infer that these tweets are probably related to specific penny stocks.

Now, for each tweet, I need to identify positive and negative factors. The first one talks about alerts gained, which could be positive. It also mentions subscriptions or URLs, which might be a sign of interest or promotion. The second tweet starts with the same idea but ends on a positive note too, talking about gains.

Assessing sentiment: Both tweets are encouraging and promoting something related to stocks, especially in an upward trend. They mention money-making opportunities or alerts, which suggests that investors are hoping for positive outcomes.

Putting it all together, each tweet is highlighting positive aspects like gains, alerts, subscriptions, and the possibility of making money. So overall, the sentiment should be positive."

2014-11-14,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on a company's stock price. The user provided a query where they want me to determine whether each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative based on stock market analysis. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the tweets and what information they're conveying. Each tweet has several parts: it starts with ""rt AT_USER"", then mentions some keywords like $ mrk c-swift data, ""embargo broken ( not by me )"", ""URL $ gild liver 14"". These look like they might be related to a company or the stock's performance.

For each tweet, I should extract the relevant information. The user provided an output format where I need to evaluate each tweet and then summarize the overall impact on the stock. Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER my story on $ mrk c-swift data . embargo broken ( not by me ) URL $ gild liver 14""

From this, I can see that it seems to be a personal message from someone, possibly regarding their observations on stock data. The mention of ""mrk"" and ""c-swift data"" could indicate they're looking at financial metrics or related information about the company. The term ""embargo broken ( not by me )"" might imply uncertainty about a political situation affecting something, which could impact stock prices if that affects revenue or earnings.

The URL ""$ gild liver 14"" is unusual and possibly a typo. It doesn't seem directly related to stock data but maybe points out some inconsistency or mistake. So, the tweet seems like it's providing info but also having some unclear or confusing content.

Putting this together, I think the tweet might be offering insights or analysis about the company's performance based on financial data, which could influence investor sentiment positively if they believe the data supports positive outlooks. However, the mention of an uncertain situation with a typo adds some uncertainty, making it less certain whether it's positive or negative.

Considering all these elements, I'm leaning towards a neutral stance because while there are mentions of relevant data, the ambiguity and possible confusion due to the URL could make the tweet's impact on the stock somewhat unclear. It might not be overwhelmingly positive or negative but could have mixed effects."

2014-11-24,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of a company based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet one by one and analyze their factors.

First tweet: It talks about Mrk and Nlnk entering into a licensing agreement for an ebola vaccine. That sounds like a positive thing because it's expanding the company's product line, which can help them meet customer needs and possibly attract more investors or customers. So that's definitely a positive factor.

Second tweet: Again mentions the same companies collaborating on the ebola vaccine agreement. This seems similar to the first one but maybe phrased slightly differently. It reinforces the idea of partnership, which is good for growth. Another positive point.

Third tweet: Similar to the previous two. They're entering into a licensing and collaboration agreement for the vaccine again. Consistent information about expansion and collaboration. So another positive.

Fourth tweet: Updating their names or status with newlink and merck signing an ebola vaccine licensing pact. This suggests that they are enhancing their commitment, which can indicate strength in position and potentially higher sales. Also, phrasing as a ""new agreement"" makes it a strong opening for potential partnerships.

Now, evaluating each tweet's factors:

1. Positive factors: Collaboration on a major agreement. Growth opportunities. New partnerships.
2. Negative factors: None immediately apparent here. The tweets are all about agreements and collaborations, not negative statements.

Assessing sentiment: All the positive factors are consistent and reinforcing. There's no indication of uncertainty or negative developments like news about rival products or financial problems that would lead to concern among investors.

Putting it together, each tweet is pointing towards a strong expansion and potential growth in the company, especially considering the health crisis and the vaccine market. The lack of negative factors makes me lean towards a positive overall sentiment."
2014-11-25,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. I'm not super familiar with all these companies or the tweets, but I'll do my best.

First, I need to identify the target stock for each tweet. But looking at the tweets provided, none of them mention a specific stock symbol. That's confusing because without knowing which company we're talking about, it's hard to assess the impact on their stock price. Maybe they're all unrelated? Or perhaps they are related to a single company.

Let me go through each tweet one by one and see what information I can gather:

1. The first tweet mentions ""bayer cherche un repreneur pour son activité diabète-sces URL $ cvc $ mrk $ zts $ bayn $ kkr $ san $ 0qoq $ kkr."" It sounds like they're talking about a partnership with someone in a specific country (likely France) to help a diabetes project. The symbols here are $ cvc, $ bayn, etc., which don't look familiar as stock codes. Maybe it's just some random stuff on Twitter.

2. The second tweet is about our platinum penny stock pick on $ sttk being up over 128%. It mentions a URL break for ""insy"" and the company is MRK. So, this seems like a news about a specific stock whose price has gone up by nearly 130% today. This could definitely impact the stock's price positively.

3. The third tweet asks if I would like research on stocks $ yum $ HCNK $ MRK $ S on the Wall Street URL. YUM is a food company, HCN is also familiar as an alternative energy company (Hydrogenated Carrot Network), and MRK is Merck. So this is another inquiry about specific stock research.

4. The fourth tweet says Merck is acquiring rights to a newlink's ebola vaccine candidate, with the URL being $ MRK. This could indicate that there's a potential increase in corporate earnings if they acquire this stock. If they're buying a company, especially one related to healthcare like Merck or Pfizer, it might positively affect their stock price.

5. The fifth tweet mentions ICY (which I think is an acronym for something, maybe ""Interesting Company"") looking beyond ebola and has a focus on pharma and biotech companies with URLs $ GSK, JNJ, EBOLA, etc. It says Merck and others are stepping back fromebola. This suggests that the company might not be as focused on medical breakthroughs anymore. If they're moving away from ebola research, it could lead to a negative outlook for their stock price if there's uncertainty.

6. The sixth tweet offers free research on $ CNK, MRK, RL, and CSIQ with URLs. CNK is a financial services company, MLK (another symbol for Merck), RL stands for Retail Liquators, and CSIQ could be a typo or something else entirely. This seems like another inquiry about stock research.

Putting it all together, the tweets seem to cover various topics related to stocks, including partnerships with other companies, news on specific stocks being affected by certain events (like Merck acquiring a vaccine candidate), changes in stock prices, and inquiries about research opportunities. However, without knowing which company we're talking about, it's challenging to determine the overall sentiment. For example, if they're all about the same company or different ones but all linked to medical breakthroughs, that could compound positively. But if there are a mix of positive news (like stock prices up) and negative news (like Merck stepping back fromebola), it might lead to mixed sentiment.

But looking at tweet 2, it's clearly a news story with a huge price increase. That's strong positive. Then tweet 4 is about acquiring a stock related to a vaccine, which could be positive if the company shows growth potential. Tweets 5 and 6 are more general inquiries but might not significantly impact the overall sentiment.

So maybe overall, there's some positive news because of the rising prices, the potential acquisition, and the inquiry about research. But without context, it's hard to say for sure. However, since tweet 2 is a clear upvote with a massive increase, that alone could be enough to lean towards [Positive]."
2014-11-26,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem step by step. The user has given me some tweets about a stock, and I need to determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative for their impact on future stock price.

First, I need to understand the task. They have provided a set of tweets related to the same stock. Each tweet is something like ""lookn 4wins : mrk +0.61 % stock charts $ mrk merck & co . inc . URL"". My job is to analyze these tweets and decide if each one contributes positively, neutrally, or negatively to the company's future performance.

Okay, so I should start by identifying the target stock symbol from the tweets. In this case, it seems to be ""mrk"" which stands for Merck & Co., an American pharmaceutical company. That’s straightforward enough.

Next, each tweet is a separate factor contributing to their overall impact on the stock price. Each tweet has a positive percentage change in the stock (like +0.61%), and there's also mention of the stock symbol being $mrk merck & co . inc., which might be part of the URL or something related, but I don't think it affects sentiment.

So each tweet is like ""Looking good! +0.61% for mrk (mrk merck & co . inc.)."" So, the positive factors are just the percentage change and maybe a bit more about where they are now? I'm not sure if that adds anything beyond just the percentage itself.

Now, from what I know, looking good is often seen as positive because it's encouraging investors. But how does this translate into stock performance?

I recall that percentage changes can be confusing because they don't account for market conditions or company fundamentals. For example, a +0.61% increase might not mean the stock will double in value unless there are specific factors like good earnings or strong revenue growth.

But since each tweet is just adding to the positive side with a small increment, maybe it's considered a positive trend. It suggests that the market is optimistic about the company and their performance. But I'm not sure if that's enough for a strong recommendation.

I should also consider how much impact a +0.61% change has. That seems like a modest improvement, but in financial terms, especially with stocks, any positive percentage could have some effect. It might not be enough to tip the balance, though, because it's just one factor each day.

In my experience, tweets often mention trends and market reactions. Even small percentages can indicate confidence or optimism among investors. So, perhaps these tweets are contributing positively by encouraging others to buy more shares.

But then again, I don't know how much each tweet is impacting the overall stock price. It could be that multiple positive tweets add up, but they might not all be in the same direction or have enough consistency.

I think a mix of trends and confidence can lead to mixed feelings because sometimes people react quickly, leading to overconfidence which might cause panic for short-term gains, even if long-term it's negative. However, each tweet is just one factor contributing to that overall sentiment.

So, considering all this, I'm leaning towards the stock being positive because looking good and positive movements in percentage increase indicate investor confidence. But I’m also a bit unsure if that alone is enough for a strong recommendation."

2014-11-29,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem step by step. So, I've got these tweets related to a stock, and my task is to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the company's future stock price. Hmm, okay, where do I start?

First off, the tweet says that $mrk merck & company's year-to-date performance has changed +20.68 percent and 8.15 percent in the last 30 days. Then it links to a URL. I'm assuming the stock symbol is mrk merck & company because it's commonly known by that ticker symbol.

Now, looking at this, the user mentions both a year-over-year increase of 20% and an increase of 8% over the last 30 days. These are positive numbers, which suggests good performance so far. But I should consider whether these metrics are indicative of future performance or just past trends.

Wait, the link is to a URL, but that doesn't provide any additional information about the company's financial health or future prospects. It might be related to something else on their website, maybe a presentation or another aspect of their operations. I don't have enough context to assess that part for sentiment.

The first tweet seems to present solid data—both increases are positive. However, without knowing more about what the stock symbol represents (like if it's a company I'm familiar with), it's hard to gauge market expectations. It might not be just the company I'm tracking but could be related to a different sector or industry.

But the most important thing is that these factors—both increases—are positive indicators, suggesting the stock has been performing well in the past. However, without knowing about future earnings reports, analyst sentiment, competitive positioning, or other external factors, it's hard to predict the overall impact on the stock price.

So, considering all this, I think the positive metrics point towards a favorable outlook, but since we don't have more context, the best I can say is that these trends are good, so it leans toward a positive sentiment. But maybe neutral because while there's strong recent performance, it doesn't necessarily guarantee future gains without more data."

2014-12-02,Neutral,"Alright, let's break down how I would approach analyzing these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price.

First, the user provided two tweets and asked me to analyze them to decide if they'll positively, neutrally, or negatively affect a company's stock price. My task is to figure out each tweet step by step.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ oncs first AT_USER of AT_USER and $ dsnky , next $ mrk and AT_USER now AT_USER and $ pki . summer conferences not a waste ..."". The user mentions several stocks like AT_USER, DSNKY, MRK, BMY, JNJ. I'm not sure what AT_USER stands for here—it could be an abbreviation for something specific to the company. The mention of summer conferences suggests maybe a strategic or operational update related to marketing or product development. While this seems positive in terms of upcoming events, it's speculative and hard to quantify how it directly impacts stock prices.

The second tweet is ""gilead sciences : less now , more later URL via AT_USER $ gild $ abbv $ mrk $ bmy $ jnj"". Gilead Sciences is known for their treatment of gene therapy. The mention of the number of users (URL) and their stock symbols indicates that this could be a signal or a deal opportunity. If Gilead's product is expected to gain traction, especially with more users, it might attract investors by increasing demand. However, without knowing the exact timing or how Gilead intends to use these users, I can't say for sure if this is positive or negative.

Considering both tweets together: The first one touches on upcoming conferences, which could be a good sign but is uncertain. The second tweet suggests a potential rise in user engagement and stock demand. While there's some optimism from the second tweet, the first seems too vague to make a strong conclusion. So overall, I think it's safer to consider it neutral because neither tweet provides definitive information about how they'll affect the stock price."

2014-12-05,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, I need to analyze some tweets about a company's stock and determine whether their impact is positive, neutral, or negative on the future stock price. The user provided two specific tweets and wants me to evaluate them.

First, I should look at each tweet separately. For the first tweet: ""top stocks today . find out why . $ cl $ emc $ mrk $ lgnd wealthmanagement URL"". It mentions top stocks but doesn't provide any specific information about a company. Maybe it's an announcement or something else unrelated to a stock. I'm not sure what it's referring to, so I can't be certain if this is related.

The second tweet: ""platinum memberships rose , after 528 % gains on penny stocks , in one month ! big update : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"". Here, the tweet talks about platinum memberships rising and mentions penny stocks with a 528% gain. It also says there's a big update related to something called ""URL"" breaking for Insy. I'm not familiar with what ""URL"" stands for in this context; maybe it's a typo or an acronym specific to the company.

Considering both tweets, they seem unrelated to each other and don't provide any direct information about a stock. The first tweet is too vague, and the second one mentions something that doesn't tie into a particular stock symbol. Since I can't identify a stock from these tweets, it's hard to assess their impact on the company's future stock price.

I also need to consider if there's any missing context or related information elsewhere. Without knowing which stock is being referred to in either tweet, it's impossible to determine the sentiment. So, based on the given information, I can't conclude whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative towards a specific stock."
2014-12-06,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of $mrk. Let me start by breaking down each tweet step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol, which is mrk based on some context. Each tweet talks about a deal for $cbst, so that's the company we're focusing on.

Looking at the tweets one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions a company trading $cbst for ~$102 per share in cash, equity valued at around $8 billion. It says the deal could come on Monday with sources mentioned as - story: url. The user is asking if mrk would be involved. This seems like an acquisition announcement, which might indicate that mrk could acquire cbst for a certain price, possibly increasing the company's valuation.

2. The second tweet mentions $mcrs and $vly but doesn't specify how it relates to $mrk. It asks about stock market reports on various companies including mcrs, vly, bwp, etc. This seems more like general market updates rather than directly related to the target stock.

3. The third tweet says that a deal for cbst wasn't finalized but could still break up, mentioning AT_USER and the date of the talk. It's talking about the possibility of the deal being broken and the timing. Again, this doesn't seem directly related to mrk, which is the focus.

4. The fourth tweet mentions hey, someone buying cbst will just pay off tsrx cvrs for a cleaner business. It also includes some emotional tone with phrases like ""bookeeping is cleaner."" This seems to express excitement about the deal and might be part of investor communication, possibly affecting sentiment positively by signaling confidence in the company.

5. The fifth tweet states that $cbst is being discussed by $mrk, mentioning infectious disease landscape changing price hikes expected. This clearly indicates a planned acquisition or strategic move for mrk due to potential changes in the market conditions like diseases and higher prices. This could be seen as a positive signal for stock performance.

6. The sixth tweet reiterates the deal for cbst but adds more details about it being discussed soon, with equity valued around $8 billion. It seems similar to other acquisition announcements, reinforcing the idea of potential growth or investment in mrk.

7. The seventh tweet talks about an anti-PD (presumptive drug development) for pembrolizumab targeting Hodgkin lymphoma, with a 66% success rate and 21% cost. This is unrelated to $mrk, so this tweet doesn't directly impact the stock price of mrk.

8. The eighth tweet suggests watching couple of stocks including mrk, mcrs, petm, and nuan visit. Again, these are other companies mentioned in previous tweets, not relevant to the target stock.

9. The ninth tweet is a repeat of the sixth tweet, further elaborating on the deal for cbst being discussed soon with expected equity value and timing.

Now, considering all these points:

- The first tweet starts an acquisition announcement but doesn't specify the time frame.
- The fourth tweet expresses excitement and might influence sentiment positively.
- The fifth and sixth tweets mention potential market changes that could drive the stock up.
- The seventh tweet is about a drug development unrelated to the target company, so it's probably neutral or negative.

Overall, multiple tweets are positive signaling for mrk, including the potential deal announcements and mentions of upcoming price changes. However, some tweets like the third or seventh (which were about other companies) could be considered neutral if they're just updates with no direct impact on $mrk. But since the majority of the relevant tweets are positive and indicate a planned acquisition driven by market uncertainties, it leans towards a positive overall sentiment."

2014-12-08,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the company. The user provided a list of tweets along with some details about each tweet. My job is to assess whether each tweet has a positive, neutral, or negative effect on the stock.

First, I need to identify which tweet is related to AT_USER, since that's what I'm analyzing for the stock price. Looking through the list, I see that several tweets mention ""AT_USER"" but not one specifically about a stock they're selling or buying. For example, some mentions are about pharmaceuticals like ""cubist pharmaceuticals,"" others talk about rocket communications and rocket biology. There's also a tweet where AT_USER sold to another user for $9.5 billion in stock, which seems unrelated.

Now, for the tweets related to AT_USER, I notice that most of them mention ""merck & co."" Their focus seems to be on buying stock with ""cubist pharmaceuticals"" or discussing rocket tech. These topics don't seem directly related to any stock listed on the stock market. However, if we consider that AT_USER is a separate entity from the company being analyzed, maybe there's some confusion here.

Looking at each relevant tweet: I see multiple tweets where AT_USER mentions selling stocks (e.g., one about AT_USER selling to another user for $9.5b). Since these are not stock transactions for any specific company, they might just be statements of interest or opinions from someone else about the company's stock. 

In the output requirement, each tweet that includes AT_USER is considered. These tweets don't mention the target stock price movement; instead, they describe AT_USER's actions regarding their own stocks. Without knowing the specifics of the stocks they're buying or selling for, it's hard to gauge the impact on the target company's stock price.

Some tweets may express confidence about buying more, which could imply optimism. But others might be speculative or based on speculation rather than real information, leading to uncertainty. Since there's no specific data or analysis of AT_USER's actions affecting the company's performance, it's challenging to assign a positive or negative sentiment.

I should consider that without knowing if these statements are positive, neutral, or negative, I can't make an accurate assessment. Therefore, maybe all these tweets should be considered as [Neutral] since there's no concrete evidence of their impact on the stock price."
2014-12-09,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets about Merck's stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the company. Let me break this down step by step.

First, each tweet seems to be related to Merck (mrk). The first tweet says something about $3 billion too much for cubicin patent loss. I know that Merck has been involved in drug patents like cubicin, so a decision affecting that could impact their earnings or stock price.

The second tweet mentions small-cap stocks breaking high prices and comparing with other companies. That doesn't seem directly related to the company's performance yet, but it might influence investor sentiment by affecting demand for smaller companies compared to larger ones.

The third tweet talks about Merck betting $9.5 billion on Cubist's Superbugs war. This sounds like they're supporting a political battle, which can cause market uncertainty and affect investor confidence.

The fourth tweet mentions legal experts not believing an appeal will be successful and suggesting that earnings might be preserved through cost cuts. This is more of a strategic statement from Merck, affecting their financials but less directly on the stock price.

The fifth tweet states that $cbst (another symbol) says the deal isn't affected by Hospira's decision and plans to appeal. This also involves potential changes in their position regarding another company, which could affect their finances if they have joint ventures or partnerships.

Putting this together, the tweets seem to be signaling potential changes in Merck's financial strategy without significant immediate impact on their stock price. They're more about what might happen rather than how it will affect the current stock. Therefore, the overall sentiment isn't positive, negative, or neutral; there's more of a trend towards uncertainty."
2014-12-10,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Merck.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at all four tweets, they all mention ""mrk,"" so I think that's Merck (MRK). The rest are about various actions related to their stock or investments.

Now, for each tweet, I should separate them into positive and negative factors. 

Tweet 1: It says ""keytruda demonstrates encouraging results in tnbc URL premarket $ mrk."" This seems like a positive statement about Merck's keytruda drug, which might be part of their product portfolio. So that's a positive factor.

Tweet 2: The user is regretting their investment in several companies listed as $hcc$, $pra$, etc. That sounds like negative sentiment about investing in those stocks.

Tweet 3: They're considering selling $i$, $twc$, and $mrk$ along with others, which shows a desire to sell or reduce positions in Merck stock. This is definitely negative because it's about reducing investment.

 Tweet 4: It mentions the stock chart for MRK with some percentages and last updated info. While this isn't a tweet about the stock itself but more about viewing something else (maybe a website), the mention of the stock could imply that they're watching its performance, which might be seen as positive if they're monitoring it.

Now, summarizing each tweet's sentiment:

1. Positive: Encouraging keytruda results.
2. Negative: Regretting investments in other stocks.
3. Negative: Considering selling Merck stock.
4. No direct mention of the stock performance but involves watching its chart.

The overall impact from these tweets seems to be a mix of positive and negative sentiments, with some investors regretting past investments while others are selling their positions now. This could lead to a mixed or uncertain outlook on Merck's future stock price."

2014-12-15,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of the given tweets on the stock price of a company. The user has provided three tweets and wants me to analyze their effect using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, looking at the target stock symbol. In the first tweet, it's ""$ mgm $ mrk $ hca $ ci newsletter URL"", but I don't have the exact stock name from that. The other two tweets mention ""mrk"" and ""ci"". So, I think the target is probably ""MRK"" since it's a common symbol for tech companies.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to identify the factors and sentiment.

The first tweet says: ""should you buy , sell or hold $ mgm $ mrk $ hca $ ci newsletter URL"". The words mentioned are $ mgm (which could be M&As), $ mrk, $ hca, $ ci. These are all names of stocks. It mentions a newsletter, which might suggest information analysis or updates about the company. However, since I don't know if it's positive or negative, it's hard to say. But the mention of buying/selling suggests it could influence investor sentiment.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ mrk news : "" the new baupost biotech picks $ atra $ aveo $ biib $ fwp $ idix $ kerx … "" URL board view : URL"". Here, I see mentions of $ mrk (which is MRK), some other stocks like ATRA, Aveco, Biib, FWP, Idix, Kerkx. The phrase ""new baupost biotech picks"" and the fact that it's related to MrK suggests they're sharing information about potential stock moves or trends. This could be a positive sign if it indicates that investors are interested in purchasing the stock because there's new information.

The third tweet is similar: ""the new baupost biotech picks URL $ atra $ aveo $ biib $ fwp $ idix $ kerx $ kin $ mrk $ prtk $ tbph $ thrx"". It again mentions multiple stocks, with $ mrk. This seems like a continuation of the previous tweet or another information release related to MRK.

Now, for sentiment analysis:

1. The first tweet is vague about positive or negative but mentions buying/selling, which might lean towards [Neutral] if it's just a news feed rather than an actual recommendation.
2. The second and third tweets are all about stock picks and trends. They're sharing information that could indicate investor interest in purchasing MRK. This trend suggests a positive outlook on the stock because more info is being made available to the market, which can influence sentiment positively.

However, I should consider other factors. The first tweet might not have enough context to confidently assess its impact. The second and third tweets are about trends and picks, which tend to be seen as positive by many investors looking for gains. 

But since the target stock isn't fully determined from the first tweet, it's hard to say definitively. If we take all three into account:

- The first is vague but mentions buying/selling, suggesting possible impact.
- The other two are about trends and picks, which are positive.

Considering all this, I might lean towards a [Positive] sentiment because multiple tweets indicate increased interest in the stock's performance or value. But I'm not entirely certain, especially since the target stock isn't fully identified yet."
2014-12-16,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of the Merck company based on these tweets. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweet ""merck & company inc . annual valuation - 2014 $ mrk - investing URL,"" it seems like they're talking about Merck Inc. So the target stock is MRK.

Next, I have to analyze each relevant tweet. But in this case, there's only one tweet provided. So I need to look at that one carefully.

The factors here are ""annual valuation"" and ""investing URL."" The word ""annual valuation"" gives me a positive factor because it suggests they're making an estimate for the company's future performance or value. That could influence investor sentiment positively as it might attract attention or make people think about future growth potential.

On the flip side, ""investing URL"" is more of a link that could be referring to a specific investment tool or platform. It doesn't directly provide information about the stock price but might indicate that investors are interested in them for something related to investing. So it's a neutral factor because while it's linked to investments, it doesn't specify if it's positive or negative towards the stock itself.

Now, assessing sentiment: The ""annual valuation"" is definitely a positive sign because Merck's management has been vocal about their financial outlook and investment plans. This could attract more investors who want to see them in the news. On the other hand, while the investing link might be positive (as it connects with the stock), it's less direct.

Putting this together: The positive factor from the annual valuation is strong enough that it should have a significant impact on the stock price. Although there are neutral factors from the URL link, they don't outweigh the clear positive sentiment from the valuation itself. So overall, I think the sentiment is going to be positive."

2014-12-19,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a given company's stock price. The user provided some sample tweets and asked me to analyze them as either Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, looking at the process outlined: the steps involve identifying the target stock symbol from the tweets, then analyzing each tweet separately to find positive and negative factors. Each tweet is evaluated for sentiment, and then all these sentiments are combined to give an overall conclusion.

Looking at the sample provided, I can see that each tweet seems like it could be part of a follow-up or continuation from previous discussions about the stock. The tweets mention things like global transactions, stock symbols, and individual mentions, which might indicate investor sentiment towards the company. However, without knowing the specific stock in question, I can't know for sure if these factors are positive or negative. 

For example, $ pvct coo / cto AT_USER says 4 provectus... Maybe this could be a statement about their performance, but it's unclear whether that would positively or negatively impact the stock price.

Since each tweet might be part of a longer narrative, I can't isolate any single factor to evaluate. So, without more context on what the company is doing, how things are going, or if it's an announcement from management or a positive development, it's hard to determine if these tweets are pushing up or down the stock.

I think in cases where each tweet might be linked and not independent, the overall sentiment isn't clear. So, maybe it's better to leave this as Neutral because there's no single positive or negative factor contributing to it."

2014-12-22,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the first tweet: #STTK. The sentiment here seems positive because it mentions a 285% gain in just five days and talks about picking the penny stock early. Positive words like ""gain"" and ""pick"" indicate confidence or expectation of good results.

Next, the second tweet is more about grants and upcoming vaccine. It mentions a $30 million grant to advance the newlink company with the Merck EBola vaccine. The focus here seems on policy or regulatory aspects rather than financial performance. These are generally neutral because they don't directly relate to stock prices unless the vaccine has a potential impact, which isn't clear here.

I should consider both factors together. The first tweet gives hope (positive), but the second might not be directly affecting the stock price. It's possible that any support for vaccines could indirectly benefit companies by increasing demand, but without concrete information on that company's current situation or market reactions, it's hard to say. However, since one factor is positive and the other seems out of context, the overall sentiment leans towards neutral."

2014-12-24,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets impact the stock price of BAYER stock. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER bbdo and jwt win , havas loses as bayer divvies up merck's former otc brands URL $ mrk pharma marketin..."". The user mentions BAYER in ""mrk pharma marketin..."", so I think the stock symbol here is BAYER.

Now, for each tweet, I have to separate Positive and Negative factors. The second tweet is another one with similar information, but it seems to mention ""bayer divvies up"", which suggests positive news about BAYER's performance. 

Next, I need to assess the sentiment of each tweet regarding investor sentiment. The first tweet talks about BAYER increasing their revenue due to certain factors and mentions other companies like merck and others, but it doesn't explicitly state whether this is positive or negative for BAYER itself. However, since they're talking about their own divvy up, it leans towards positive.

The second tweet is slightly different—it's more about ""bayer divvies up,"" which reinforces the idea that BAYER is doing well, so sentiment should be positive here as well.

After analyzing both tweets, I can see consistent positive language related to BAYER. There are no negative mentions, and the focus is on their performance and company standing. 

So combining these factors—positive tweets about BAYER's performance—it suggests that the overall sentiment for the stock is Positive."

2014-12-26,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of Merck. The user provided three tweets and wants an analysis of their likely effect on Merck's stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at ""merck : fulford india divests consumer care biz URL $ mrk"", it seems the target stock is Merck (MRK). 

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate positive and negative factors. The first tweet mentions Fulford India divesting consumer care business, which could affect their operations, potentially influencing revenue or profits. It also includes a link to $50 billion, which might be related to funding or expenses.

I'm not sure about the rest of the tweets, but I'll focus on the first one. The mention of a dividend and dividend yield is positive because it increases cash flow and could improve stock performance. However, the divesting activity (Consumer Care Business) might be a concern if it reduces their revenue streams. But without more context, I can't say for sure.

Considering the factors—dividend, potential profitability from remaining operations, and financial metrics—the overall sentiment isn't clear enough to decide. There are conflicting signals: positive due to dividend but negative due to divesting.

Since there's a mix of positive and negative aspects with limited clarity, it seems like the stock could have a neutral impact."

2015-01-02,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price for a specific company. The user provided a set of tweets and asked me to determine whether each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock.

First, I'll start by analyzing each tweet one by one. Let's take the first tweet: ""$ bmy $ mrk $ azn risk-adjusted scenarios for us and ww io market , 2020e & 2025e ( by company ) URL"". Hmm, this seems to be addressing some economic scenarios or future expectations related to two companies: BMY, MRK, and AZN. The word ""risk-adjusted"" suggests that there's a financial analysis here about potential risks and their adjusted outcomes in the upcoming years.

Now, I need to figure out how these tweets influence investor sentiment towards any specific stock mentioned, probably BMY since it's one of the companies cited. The mention of future scenarios might imply that the tweet is providing insights or projections for the company. Risk-adjusted scenarios could mean considering various risks and planning accordingly, which would be positive for investors because they're prepared for potential challenges.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Could this tweet also affect other stocks? The mention of ""ww io market"" suggests a broader economic context involving WWS and IO, but unless these are specific to BMY's performance, it might be more about the overall market or sector rather than individual stocks.

Putting it all together, the tweet is addressing future scenarios for multiple companies with a focus on risk adjustment. It seems like the information provided by the tweet is about potential growth opportunities or risks, which would generally benefit investors who are looking for growth potential. Therefore, this should be a positive impact because it's providing valuable insights that could drive stock prices."

2015-01-06,Negative,"Okay, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. The user provided three tweets and wants me to assess each for positive, neutral, or negative effects.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER and then there were three , as $ jnj / bavarian nordic's ebola vaccine follows $ gsk , $ mrk / newlink into phase i study URL."" This seems like a mention of a social media post where users are expressing support for certain companies. The inclusion of an ebola vaccine, which is obviously positive, suggests that investors might be more optimistic about the company's ability to combat the virus. But I need to consider context—without knowing if this is from a stock price, it's hard to tell.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER swiss trial resumes with newlink / merck ebola vaccine URL ebola $ nlnk $ mrk $ gsk nih niaid pharma …"" This also looks like another social media post. The mention of a SWISS trial, which is a significant medical trial, could be positive because it shows the company is actively working on solving the problem. However, without knowing if this is related to the stock, it's speculative.

The third tweet: ""$ mrk closed +2.28 @ $ 60.32 on heaviest volume since jan . 2014 . thirteen year high hit this past dec @ $ 62.20 could be a magnet . djia - 130."" This seems like a news story about the stock price movement. It mentions closing up by a significant margin, which is positive because it can indicate confidence in the company's performance. The DJIA down by 130%? That's a big drop, but combined with the 2.28 increase and specific volume data, it might suggest increased trading activity.

Putting this together: The first tweet talks about support for companies, which could be positive if the user is referring to stock prices. The second mentions a medical trial, which can sometimes attract investors. The third clearly states a significant price movement with DJIA down, which is negative because it reflects market concern and may lead to selling.

So overall, considering these factors, there's a mix of possible positives and some negatives. But the strongest points are from the first tweet about support for companies and the third tweet about the stock price drop."
2015-01-07,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The tweet mentions Dow Jones indices and other financial metrics. It talks about better value in MRK (MSFT) by +3.93% and worse value in JPM (JPM). 

First, the context is about financial performance or market conditions affecting two different stocks. The positive part (+3.93%) suggests that one company is performing well compared to others in the same index. However, the negative part (-2.59%) might indicate some underlying issues with the other company.

But looking at the broader picture, these tweets are more about interpreting market data rather than predicting future performance. They don't provide any specific analysis or outlook on the company's future prospects. It seems like they're offering commentary on current performance metrics without projecting what will happen in the near term.

So, from an investment perspective, the tweet is giving investor information but isn't making a prediction about future stock movements. Therefore, it's neutral because it doesn't present any positive or negative trends that would impact the stock price significantly."

First, the user wants me to determine how this tweet affects the stock price. Since it's only one tweet, I can't gather all relevant information, so I have to make an assumption based on the context.

Looking at the phrase ""mrk headlines,"" which likely refers to a specific stock or company (maybe Microsoft), and the sector mentioned is ""health-care."" The word ""URL"" suggests that this tweet might be linked to a new product or service launch in the health-care industry. 

From my experience, companies in the health-care sector have been doing well recently, especially in areas like biotech, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare technology. A successful new product or innovation can boost investor confidence, which would generally lead to positive sentiment.

However, I also consider any potential negatives, but without specific details about this particular tweet, it's hard to say. If the health-care sector is doing well because of this new URL, the impact might be positive. 

So, weighing the information and considering general trends in the industry, I think the overall sentiment is likely positive."

2015-01-11,Positive,"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided three tweets and wants to determine their likely impact on a company's stock price. They specified that each tweet is about the same company, so I'll need to analyze them all together.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""our penny stock picks gained over 968 % in 5 weeks ! get our next pick early : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". Here, it seems like the stock symbol is MRK, which stands for Microsoft.

Next, I'll look at each tweet individually to extract factors and assess sentiment. 

The first tweet mentions a penny stock gaining over 968% in five weeks and suggests getting the next pick early via URL stocks. The part ""URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"" looks like it's providing information about Microsoft (MRK), suggesting they are looking for their stock prices, which might indicate a positive outlook.

The second tweet is about Merck & Co., Inc. It mentions JP Morgan in a health care conference context and provides stock ticker: MRK. This could mean that Merck is considering investing in the company or evaluating them based on some strategic reason related to their health sector presence, possibly indicating a neutral sentiment if it's a favorable move.

The third tweet lists several stock tickers: URL $ blue $ celg $ juno $ kite $ mrk. Similar to the first tweet, it looks like they're providing stock information for Microsoft (MRK), reinforcing the idea that they might be interested in investing or monitoring their performance.

Now, considering each tweet together:

1. The first tweet hints at a positive future with high gains, suggesting excitement and potential.
2. The second tweet is about Merck & Co., which could imply a strategic relationship or interest in Microsoft's health sector.
3. The third tweet again focuses on Microsoft (MRK), reinforcing the positive outlook.

Since all tweets are centered around Microsoft and mention it in various contexts—like investments, conference discussions—it implies that the company is performing well, possibly leading to an increase in stock price. 

Sentiment-wise, while some tweets might suggest a positive outlook, others could indicate uncertainty or mixed signals due to market dynamics. However, given the repeated mentions of MRK and the overall context of stock gains, it's leaning towards a Positive sentiment.

Therefore, I'll conclude that this tweet series likely leads to a Positive impact on the stock price."
2015-01-12,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of ""mrk"". I'm not very experienced in analyzing stock market trends based on tweets, but I'll do my best.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Hmm, looking at the first tweet: ""url stuffit : $ mrk merck provides update on strategic actions to : stuffit URL URL"". It doesn't explicitly mention the stock symbol, so maybe it's referring to a different company or perhaps the symbol is more clearly stated elsewhere. Wait, in some of the subsequent tweets, they do mention the stock symbol like ""mrk"" or specific companies.

Looking at tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER our own ken frazier talks $ mrk updates with AT_USER from AT_USER at jpm 15 . URL"". Here, it's clear that the stock is ""mrk"". So I can use ""Mrk"" as the target stock symbol.

Now, moving to each tweet individually. 

Tweet 1: It mentions a URL for something called stuffit and updates on strategic actions. Nothing directly about the stock. Probably not relevant unless stuffit is related to Mrk, which isn't clear from the context.

Tweet 2: This one talks about AT_USER's updates with their own ken frazier talking about MrK. The mention of ""AT_USER"" doesn't give me much info on the company itself. It seems like just some casual interaction from a user. So I'll skip this for now since it doesn't tie directly to the stock.

Tweet 3: This tweet mentions $mrk accelerating drug-submission plans with keytruda for lung cancer around mid-yr and mentions HCV, which I know is a virus but not directly linked to the company. It also talks about some trials and NTCs. Again, this seems more like an internal update rather than directly affecting the stock price unless it's related to revenue or partnerships.

Tweet 4: This tweet updates MrK with timelines for HCV trials, noting that there are three main naive and transactional (tx) exp trials in Fshed RCRTNG. It also mentions some NTCs. Again, this is talking about future developments and trials without any direct mention of the stock price or financial performance.

So, summarizing my thoughts: None of these tweets directly mention the stock symbol ""mrk"", which means I can't determine its performance based on these tweets alone. They talk about upcoming updates, partnerships, and research but not anything related to the company's profitability, revenue, earnings, or market position.

Wait, tweet 4 mentions HCV trials in Fshed RCRTNG. If I knew more about HCV and how that relates to MrK, maybe there could be some correlation, but as it stands, without direct info on the stock, I can't say much.

Therefore, since none of these tweets provide specific information about the stock's performance or any impact on its price, my best guess is that they have a [Neutral] sentiment. There's no positive or negative indication here."
2015-01-13,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user has provided three tweets and wants me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the tweets. In tweet 1, the URL starts with ""the most accurate stock alert service made $240,000 yesterday"" followed by breaks in some stocks: insy, mrk. So it seems like the target stock is perhaps the stock of a company whose name isn't fully given here. Maybe I can infer from context that maybe it's something related to investment services or tech, considering mentions of MRK (Merrill Lynch) and others.

Wait, tweet 1 is about making money with certain stocks, so maybe it's referring to a specific stock in the market. But without knowing the exact company name, I might have some trouble assessing sentiment directly. So perhaps I should focus on the other tweets since they are more explicit.

Tweet 2 mentions the sentiment for SP1500 stocks at midday of January 13, 2015, with sentiments towards certain companies: mrk, amzn, thc, ibm, aet. Hmm, ""thc"" doesn't ring a bell as a stock symbol I recognize. Maybe it's an abbreviation or typo? ""Thc"" could stand for something else, but without more context, it's hard to say. 

Tweet 3 talks about the speaker speaking with a BMS oncology head who isn't convinced that PDL 1 expression is necessary for responses. The tweet mentions JPM 15 and MRK. So again, MRK is in here, which might be related.

So, focusing on the explicit mentions: mrk from tweets 1 and 3. Maybe both these tweets are about MRK stock performance.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet's factors and sentiment towards the stock.

For Twitter 1, it says the service made $240,000 yesterday with breaks in insy, mrk, etc. This seems like a positive message because it's making money. If they're breaking into these stocks and generating revenue or profit, that would be good news for investors. So this tweet is positive.

Tweet 2 talks about sentiment towards SP1500 stocks at midday on January 13, 2015, but the stock symbols there are mrk, amzn, thc, ibm, aet. If it's about market sentiment, and given that amZN (Amazon) is often down during earnings season, maybe this tweet could be neutral or negative depending on the context. But without knowing what those stocks were doing, it's hard to say.

Tweet 3 is about a BMS oncology head not believing in PDL 1 expression being necessary for responses. That seems like a negative statement because it's about something non-relevant or possibly incorrect information. If the speaker is critical of their professional opinion, that could be seen as negative sentiment towards the stock.

So putting this together: Tweet 1 is positive (MRK makes money). Tweets 2 and 3 are more about broader market sentiments, which might not directly impact MRK's stock price unless those stocks are in the SP1500. Given that tweet 2 talks about a specific date in 2015, it's possible that this relates to the company's performance during that time, but since I don't know what amZN was doing then, it's uncertain.

Therefore, considering only the tweets directly related to MRK (tweets 1 and 3), tweet 1 is positive about making money, which is good. Tweets 2 are too vague or relate to a different company. So overall, the positive tweet makes me think the stock could go up, but it's not the sole factor.

Wait, maybe I should consider all relevant tweets. Tweet 2 mentions sentiment towards SP1500 stocks on that specific date, which might affect amZN performance during that time, but if amZN is a separate entity from MRK, then tweet 3 about their head's opinion isn't directly related unless amZN is in the same sector or industry as MRK.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps it's safest to say that without clear evidence of positive or negative news affecting MRK, I can't make a confident determination. But since tweet 1 is definitely positive (making money), maybe that's enough to lean towards a positive overall sentiment."

2015-01-16,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets about the stock price of a company and determine if it's going to be positive, neutral, or negative. The user has already provided two tweets, and they've outlined some steps to follow.

First, I need to identify the target stock. Looking at the tweets, both seem related to ""MINE"". So the stock is MINE.

Next, I'll process each tweet separately.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER AT_USER no . ( p . s . doubtful that $ mrk will launch hcv product in 2015 . )"". Hmm, this seems like a joke or maybe some Twitter spam. The user is talking about MRE (which I think is MINE on Twitter), but there's something confusing with AT_USER and p.s., which might be part of some code or typo. It mentions that the user is doubtful about $MKE (probably another stock) launching HCV in 2015. Wait, isn't $MKE a different stock? Maybe it's a mistake. So this tweet seems to be a bit confusing and possibly speculative. I'm not sure what the sentiment here is; it could be ambiguous or maybe just nonsensical.

The second tweet: ""$ mine stock forum updated thursday january 15, 2015 5:59:25 pm $ mrk $ pcln $ mine $ jnj URL"". This looks like an email from a forum member talking about the stock's update. It mentions various financial terms but doesn't provide any information about MINE. The mention of ""jnj"" is probably a typo for JNJ, which might be a company, possibly in the sector. But since it's a forum message and not a tweet, it might just be discussing the stock without providing any direct information.

Putting both tweets together, I don't see any positive or negative sentiment indicators. The first tweet is ambiguous, and the second is just a discussion without clear emotions. So overall, it seems neutral."

The user provided some tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on a company's stock price using just positive, neutral, or negative. Okay, so first, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweet: ""6 ways to trade merck this week - dragonfly capital $ mrk , URL"". The keyword here is MRK, which stands for Merck, so that's the stock symbol.

Next, I have to analyze each tweet one by one as per the steps outlined. Each tweet talks about trading strategies for Merck stock. So every tweet here seems positive because they're discussing ways to trade and provide links, implying a positive outlook on the stock.

But wait, I should consider if these tweets are providing any investment advice or just talking about trading ideas. If it's all about discussing potential trades, maybe the sentiment is more about promotion rather than actual buy/sell signals. But looking at the output requirement, they asked for overall sentiment, so perhaps each tweet contributes to a positive trend.

However, I should be cautious not to jump to conclusions without analyzing specific factors like company performance, market conditions, or any other external data that might influence investor sentiment. But since all tweets are just discussing trading strategies and don't include any news about the company's performance or future projections, maybe they're more about user-generated content than actual stock-moving events.

So, considering all this, each tweet is positive in promoting trading ideas without indicating a clear buy or sell decision. Therefore, the overall sentiment should be neutral because there are no clear signals of support or lack of support for the stock."

2015-01-23,Neutral,"Alright, I'm looking at the user's query about determining the impact on a company's stock price based on tweets. They provided a tweet and asked to analyze it using a specific set of steps. 

First, I need to figure out what the user is really after. They want me to take a step-by-step approach to evaluate the sentiment in these tweets. The goal is to determine if they think the stock is going up, staying the same, or down.

Looking at the tweet: ""rt AT_USER cs i-o positioning $ mrk $ bmy $ azn $ iphyf URL"". I see a few components here. There are mentions of multiple companies like $ mrk, $ bmy, $ azn, and $ iphyf. The word ""positioning"" appears in some of these, which probably relates to stock performance or something else the user is interested in.

Now, considering my analysis process: I'll identify the target stock symbol first. But here, the tweet doesn't mention a specific stock—it seems like it's about various companies listed with symbols like $ mrk. 

Each relevant tweet could influence investor sentiment based on these factors. The word ""positioning"" might indicate something about their strategy or market position, which could either boost or hinder future performance.

I should break this down. If the tweets suggest that the company is in a good position or has successful strategies, that would be positive. If they're negative or uncertain, it might lead to more negative sentiment.

Since there are multiple mentions of different stocks, I need to consider each one individually. But without knowing the stock symbols and their current status, it's tricky. However, based on ""positioning,"" it leans towards potential positive factors for some companies but maybe uncertainty from others.

Putting this together, I think the overall sentiment here is neutral because while there are various signals about different stocks, they don't conclusively point to a clear trend of up or down."

First, in tweet 1, it mentions that their penny stock picks are gaining 117% over three days with a new pick being announced. The user is using symbols like ijjp, qlts, insy, and mrk. I'm not sure what's inside those symbols, but the key point here seems to be that they're getting a big return. That sounds positive because it shows strength or improvement in their stock.

In tweet 2, there's something about drugmakers receiving mysterious invitations from the White House. The user is using $ regn and $ vrtx. I'm not sure what these symbols represent, but the context of drug companies getting invited to a high official position sounds like positive news. It could indicate that these companies are well-positioned for future opportunities or partnerships.

Now, tweet 3 mentions $ mrk alert + URL 63. The ""alert"" part might mean they're expecting something positive, maybe a new deal or a significant event. The number 63 is probably the stock price or some metric they're monitoring. An alert suggests that there's a favorable signal about their stock.

Putting it all together, each tweet seems to be pointing towards a positive outlook for MRK. The first one talks about gains, the second about upcoming deals, and the third about expecting an alert. All these signals are positive indicators that the stock is doing well and could continue to rise. So overall, this looks like a strong positive sentiment."

First tweet: It talks about the immunotherapy market being around $30 billion and mentions companies like MRK, MRY, and IPHF. Immunotherapy is a medical treatment, but it's usually expensive, which might be a red flag for investors. High costs could mean higher expenses, so that might be a negative factor.

Second tweet focuses on the gasoline tax cut affecting energy markets, specifically consumer-based earnings. Tax cuts are generally seen as positive by some, but if they're on gasoline, which is a luxury product in many places, it might affect consumers negatively or not much at all. This could lead to lower demand for electric vehicles or other alternatives.

So putting it together: The immunotherapy tweet suggests expensive costs (negative), while the gas tax cut affects energy earnings, which might impact consumer sentiment positively if people are more inclined towards fuel efficiency but negatively otherwise. However, both factors seem significant enough that they might weigh against the stock performance."

2015-02-02,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, the user provided two tweets and asked to analyze their impact on a stock's future price. The possible responses are Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet, ""mrk - market snapshot : gasoline ' tax cut ' in focus on energy , consumer-based earnings URL"". Hmm, that doesn't seem specific enough. Maybe it's referring to a company named Mrk? Not sure yet.

The second tweet is more ambiguous: ""rt brittanyumar : is $ mrk a buy here ? should you wait for $ shak to come down ? jimcramer answers these questions and … URL"". It mentions ""mrk"" again but doesn't specify the stock. Also, the mention of ""shak"" isn't familiar, so I'm not sure what that refers to.

Since both tweets mention ""mrk"", maybe that's a typo or a miswrite. Without more context, it's hard to determine which company we're talking about. But since the user provided specific tags [Positive], [Neutral], and [Negative], I might need to make an assumption here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a common stock symbol? Not sure.

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate into positive and negative factors. The first tweet seems to provide information that might influence investor sentiment towards a company. It mentions focusing on energy and consumer-based earnings, which could hint at positive factors like improved market conditions or strong earnings expectations. So maybe that's a Positive factor.

The second tweet is more vague. ""Is $ mrk a buy here?"" suggests a question about whether the stock should be bought. jimcramer answers these questions, so it seems like he's providing an opinion. The mention of waiting for something to come down might indicate uncertainty or a possible negative outlook if someone thinks that future earnings will decrease.

Without specific context on which tweet is more relevant or the company mentioned, I can't conclusively assess both. But given the first tweet provides information about market snapshot and focus areas, it's likely positive. The second tweet's speculative nature makes it harder to evaluate.

Considering the uncertainty from both tweets, especially since one is more specific about energy topics while the other is quite vague with a clear intent on buying or waiting, I'm leaning towards Positive overall because the first tweet suggests improving conditions which might be positive for investors. The second tweet adds another layer of potential, but without more clarity, it's safer to go with the First Tweet.

So, putting it all together, I'll conclude with [Positive] as the overall sentiment."
2015-02-03,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for predicting the stock price of a company. The user provided four tweets and an example output. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet one by one. The target stock symbol isn't given, but let's assume it's something like ""ABC"" for a company I'm familiar with. So, in the previous example, they concluded ""[Positive]"" because of positive factors.

For each tweet:

1. **icymi : prolife groups blame AT_USER in part , for surging measlesoutbreak URL $ mrk mmr vaccinations measles**
   - The user mentions that prolife groups are blaming AT_USER for a surging measles outbreak and suggests vaccines should be prioritized.
   - ""Surging measles outbreak"" is a red flag. I know that measles can lead to death, which might negatively impact the company's financials because people's health could suffer.
   - The mention of vaccines as a priority makes me think it could positively influence the stock price by reducing costs and perhaps profits from vaccines sold in the area.

So, combining these factors: some negative about the health issue affecting the company (measles) but positive about prioritizing vaccination efforts. It's unclear whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative because both factors are present. But I'm leaning towards a mixed result, which would probably fall under ""[Neutral]"" since it's not entirely positive nor negative.

2. **mrk mmr vaccinations measles**
   - ""mmr"" likely stands for mMR (maybe a typo for mMR, which could be ""mMR"" but actually stands for something else; perhaps it's a typo or different abbreviation?), and the tweet says vaccines should be prioritized.
   - Again, the focus on prioritizing vaccines is positive. It encourages people to get vaccinated, which can lower costs and possibly increase demand.

Considering the previous tweet had mixed factors, this one also centers around prioritizing vaccination efforts but focuses more on the positive aspect of promoting vaccines. So, it's still a mix, leading me to ""[Neutral]"".

3. **mrk mmr vaccinations measles**
   - Similar to the second tweet, it again mentions prioritizing vaccines and addressing the surging measles outbreak.
   - The emphasis is strong on vaccination efforts, which is positive for investor sentiment.

Again, this tweet has both positive (prioritizing) and negative (measles) factors. Still a mix, so ""[Neutral]"".

4. **mrk mmr vaccinations measles**
   - Same as the third, it emphasizes prioritizing vaccines to combat the surging measles outbreak.
   - The focus is again on positive aspects: promoting vaccination and reducing costs.

Putting it all together, each tweet has both positive (vaccination) and negative (measles) factors. Since there's no clear majority in either direction, it seems neutral. So, the overall sentiment would be ""[Neutral]"".

I think that makes sense because sometimes news about public health issues can affect stock prices by affecting demand or costs, but without a clear trend towards positive or negative trends. It's a balance between different opinions."
2015-02-04,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company, specifically looking at their impact on WMT. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start with identifying the target stock. From the first tweet, it seems like the stock is WMT, which stands for Wavestone Group. So my focus is on how these tweets will influence WMT's stock price.

Looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions ""the best gift you can give is stock : $ wmt $ mrk $ pg . ... URL gifts"". This seems to be a promotional or encouraging message, which might be positive for the company. It could boost investor confidence and encourage them to buy more shares.

2. The second tweet is ""$ mrk pd1 keytruda 50m in sales 4q14"". This looks like financial data indicating that MRK has 50 million units in sales during the past quarter. Positive sales figures can be a good indicator of growth and could positively impact stock price.

3. The third tweet is ""AT_USER interesting . how far along is $ mrk do you know ? hepc so tricky . morningstar does decent job at taking a stab "". This seems more like an informative or maybe even a bit casual message about the stock MRK, mentioning something about knowing it well and MRK being taken by MorningStar. It might provide information that could influence investor expectations but doesn't seem extremely positive or negative.

4. The fourth tweet is ""gain from movement in these buzzing assets usdcad $ gsk $ pg $ sbux $ mrk URL"". This seems to discuss how movements in certain assets can give gain, specifically focusing on WMT (mrk). If other stocks are performing well and if this suggests positive news about WMT's performance, it could indicate a positive trend.

Now, I'll assess each tweet's impact. The first two tweets seem to be promotional and financial statements that might provide positive signals or confirm positive trends. The third tweet is more informational but doesn't present strong evidence for positivity or negativity. The fourth tweet introduces the idea that other assets are moving in a certain way, which could be seen as a signal of how assets perform affecting WMT.

Putting this together: Promotional and financial information often can be seen as positive by investors because they show confidence or expected success. Positive sales data is usually good. However, there's some mention of Morningstar and other factors, but I'm not sure if that adds strong positive sentiment. The fourth tweet could mean that the stock is expected to move higher due to movements in other assets, which might be seen as a mixed signal.

Overall, while the first two tweets are strong positive indicators, the third seems a bit ambiguous, and the fourth introduces an expectation of movement in other sectors. This mix makes it hard to determine a clear overall sentiment without more context on how these factors relate specifically to WMT."
2015-02-05,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of the company. The user provided four tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on the stock using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER top 10 therapeutic areas in us in 2013 . hcv makes the list in 2015 $ gild $ mrk $ biib URL"". Hmm, the address is AT_USER, but I don't know what company that stands for. Maybe it's a typo or irrelevant information about a company. So, probably this tweet isn't relevant to the stock price of a specific company.

The next tweet: ""rt TESLOR $ teslhorizon stock quote"". Again, AT_USER is used again, so maybe that's not a target company either. It seems like some tweets aren't pointing towards any real stocks. I should probably ignore these since they don't relate to the stock of interest.

Third tweet: ""rt ZOO$150 $ zoonik $ biib url"". Again, AT_USER appears in the address. Maybe this is a typo for another company, but without knowing the exact name, it's hard to determine which stock that refers to. If this tweet mentions ZOO or Zoonik, I might have to assume it's referring to a stock symbol, but since it's not clear, it's risky.

Fourth tweet: ""rt TRD$150 $ tirdx $ biib url"". Same issue here; AT_USER is used again. Maybe this one refers to TRD or Tirdx? If so, without knowing the specific company, it's difficult to assess the stock performance. It could be a positive trend for a tech company, but without context, it's hard to say.

Now, considering all four tweets, none of them clearly indicate which stock I should analyze. The first tweet is about therapeutic areas and stock indices, which doesn't relate to any real company. The others are again using AT_USER in addresses that don't specify a company name. Since I can't determine the target stock from these tweets, I have no basis to assess their impact on the stock price.

Therefore, without information about the target stock or its performance based on these tweets, it's impossible to conclude if the overall sentiment is Positive, Neutral, or Negative. The lack of context makes this analysis unreliable."
2015-02-06,Missing,File not found
2015-02-07,Negative,"Alright, let's break down how I approached this task step by step.

First, I needed to identify the target stock from the provided tweets. The tweet mentions several company names like AT_USER, mt, 2014 review, and so on. It seems like these are biosimilars or something related, possibly a pharmaceutical company given some of the names like Teva, Amgn, etc.

Next, I separated each tweet into positive and negative factors. For example, ""my biosimilars 2014 review"" probably has a positive aspect about recent reviews. However, it ends with ""cc ... $ nvs $ hsp $ pfe $ eprs $ amgn $ lly $ mnta $ mrk $ teva cc"", which is negative, indicating a strong negative sentiment.

I then evaluated each tweet's sentiment by considering the overall impact. The positive factors are less clear but seem supportive of continued growth, while the negatives from ""cc"" and other negative terms likely have a significant influence.

Finally, combining all these factors, it looks like the tweet has mixed signals—some positives and strong negatives. This makes the overall sentiment somewhat negative."
2015-02-08,Missing,File not found
2015-02-09,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price for the given company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at both tweets, neither mentions an actual stock name. Hmm, that might be a problem because without knowing which stock they're referring to, it's hard to determine its current status. Maybe these are generic statements or unrelated investments? That could mean uncertainty about whether any specific company is rising or falling.

Next, I'll look at each tweet individually and separate the factors into positive and negative. The first tweet talks about an interview with CEO Leo Ehrlich for CellCeutix and mentions that the drug will be distributed under another company, $CTIX. This seems like a regulatory announcement, which could affect the stock price if it's related to safety or compliance issues. It might impact the stock of CellCeutix, but since I don't know what that is, I can't say for sure.

The second tweet discusses the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation being removed from $BMY and $MRK. That could influence these stocks because if the FDA changes their designation, it might signal changes in treatment guidelines or approvals. However, without knowing which company we're talking about here, it's tricky. If they're referring to a different stock, this change might have its own implications.

Putting that aside for now, I'll focus on the factors and sentiment. The first tweet has both positive and negative aspects: it talks about their product being distributed elsewhere and mentions regulatory updates. These could be viewed as neutral because they don't provide clear boosts or weaknesses but rather a mix of information.

The second tweet is more direct. It's stating that the FDA will remove its breakthrough designation, which might lead to changes in stock prices if these companies are part of a drug development process. The negative nature here suggests potential for下跌, while the positive note indicates it could have an effect on their performance.

Combining both tweets, they don't provide conclusive information about any particular company's stock price movement. They're more about signaling regulatory changes and product distribution. Without knowing which stock these are referring to or their current state, I can't determine if there's a trend upward or downward. 

Therefore, without specific context on the target stock, I should conclude that it's [Neutral] because the information provided is vague and doesn't paint a clear picture of positive or negative sentiment."

2015-02-17,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Codexis' stock price. So, I see there are two positive factors mentioned: ""url $ amgn $ gsk $ mrk $ cdxs"". That seems like a lot of keywords related to the company's products or operations. 

First, I need to break down each tweet one by one. The first tweet has several mentions of amgn, gsk, mrk, and cdxs. These are likely referring to different aspects or products of the company, which could be good signs for investors because it shows confidence in their performance or future plans.

Then there's a negative factor: codexis URL. Wait, ""codexis"" isn't mentioned before. Maybe that's another keyword related to the stock? Or perhaps it's referring to another part of the user's query that I missed? Hmm, no, looking back, it says [Negative] only when the tweet is relevant. So this one might be negative if it relates negatively to Codexis.

But wait, the user provided two tweets: "" numerous catalysts for codexis URL $ amgn $ gsk $ mrk $ cdxs"" and then another line that's all caps with no keywords except perhaps some acronyms. Maybe I misread the second tweet—it could be something else entirely. Let me check again.

The user wrote:

1. numerous catalysts for codexis URL $ amgn $ gsk $ mrk $ cdxs

2. [Negative] only when referring to another topic.

So, the first tweet is about positive factors: lots of keywords like codexis URL and others. The second line says ""[Negative] only when referring to another topic,"" which might mean it's a negative statement not related to the stock.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because if the user wrote both tweets about the same topic, maybe the second one is redundant or just part of a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user made an error in parsing and the second tweet isn't relevant unless it refers back to a specific factor. But without more context, I can only go by what's provided.

So, focusing on the first tweet: numerous catalysts for codexis URL... That suggests there are multiple positive points bringing good news, which should boost the stock. The keywords point towards the company's performance or growth potential. Therefore, combining all these factors, it looks like there's a clear and strong indicator of positive sentiment.

The second line being ""[Negative] only when referring to another topic"" might be a typo or error because if it refers back to something else unrelated, then it would negatively impact the stock price. But since I don't have more context on what that other topic is, I can't be certain. However, given that the first tweet provides multiple positive keywords without any mention of negatives, it's safe to assume that this tweet contributes positively.

So overall, considering the numerous catalysts and the positive keywords, the impact on Codexis' stock price should be positive."

2015-02-20,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of Merck and Novartis. Let me break it down.

First, looking at the target stock, it's likely Merck. But wait, the second tweet mentions Novartis, so maybe both are involved. 

For each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. The first tweet is about Merck: ""jefferies analyst jeffrey holford price target revisions : merck $ mrk to $ 63 from $ 69 ; novartis $ nvs to chf 109 from chf 102 .""

Hmm, the analyst is updating Merck's stock price and Novartis' quote. For Merck, it's going down from $69 to $63. That seems like a negative move for Merck. But what about Novartis? The quote changes, but since Merck is the target, I'll focus on that part.

So there's one positive factor (Merck) and one negative factor (Novartis). Now, how do these affect investor sentiment? Both factors are impacting different companies. Merck's stock goes down, which is a direct impact on their price. Novartis' quote might not directly affect Merck but could influence each other indirectly.

But since the main tweet is about Merck's price target, I think the primary impact is on Merck itself. The price dropping from $69 to $63 suggests investors are concerned or surprised about that. On the flip side, Novartis might be affecting market sentiment in a broader sense, but the stock of Merck as the target is key.

So overall, there's more negative factors for Merck than positive ones because while both are mentioned, the primary focus is on Merck being sold down. Therefore, I think this tweet is likely negative."

2015-02-25,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the company. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the first tweet: abbv. That stands for AbbVie Biotech, a major biotech company. The second tweet has russ, maybe Russell square, also in biotech. 

For each tweet, I need to extract factors and assess sentiment. Starting with the first tweet: It says ""heavy news day for several biotech stocks."" The word ""biotech"" is significant because AbbVie is part of that space. Heavy news usually indicates a positive event, so this seems like a positive factor.

Next, looking at the second tweet: ""russ company info updated tuesday february 24 2015 5:03:19 pm"" and includes russ square's URL. Updating company info on a specific date could indicate that there was some news or data release, which might be seen as positive if it affects investor expectations of the stock.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet. The first one mentions multiple biotech stocks, which is good because it suggests several companies are doing well, leading to higher overall sentiment. The second tweet about updating company info on February 24th could provide more context or a clearer picture before the stock performance is measured.

Considering both tweets together, the fact that both target biotech stocks and there's an event day in February (which can be a busy time for tech companies) strengthens the positive outlook. The lack of any negative information suggests mixed sentiment, but combining the two could still lean towards positivity overall.

Therefore, considering both factors and the context provided by both tweets, the overall sentiment is likely Positive."
2015-02-26,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company, MRK, which is Merck. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk - generic copies of remicade go on sale in europe URL"". The mention of a sale for remicade products in Europe seems like it's related to medical supplies or maybe some product line expansion. I'm not sure if this is positive, negative, or neutral because it depends on the context and how it aligns with the company's current strategy.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER lower-priced generic copies of anti-inflammatory drug remicade have gone on sale in europe URL via AT_USER $ mrk …"". This seems similar to the first one. It mentions a sale for anti-inflammatory drugs, which are often seen as essential for healthcare and patient care. This could positively impact the stock because it might attract more investors looking for accessible medical products.

The third tweet: ""dow stocks $ mrk merck daily : 0.22 % weekly : -0.53 % ytd : 2.99 % trend : 32 / 100 URL"". This seems like a financial report with percentages and a percentage point increase. The positive trends here might indicate confidence in the company's performance, but without knowing how these metrics are used or what they mean for the stock price, it's hard to assess their impact.

Putting it all together: The first two tweets talk about sales of medical products, which could be seen as a good sign if the company is expanding into more markets or targeting specific audiences. The third tweet is financial data showing positive trends, which might boost investor confidence but again, without knowing how they're used in reality, I can't say for sure.

I think the main factors are the sales updates from merck, especially around anti-inflammatory drugs and medical devices. These could be related to the company's product offerings and possibly their marketing efforts. The financials suggest a positive outlook with growth potential but maybe some uncertainty about how these updates translate into actual stock gains."
2015-02-27,Missing,File not found
2015-02-28,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price for a given company based on the provided information. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from both tweets: both mention ""mrk"", which is the ticker symbol for Merck. So the stock in question is Merck, also known as Merckx or MErck. 

Now, let's analyze each tweet separately. The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER dow jones $ djia today : merck $ mrk leads the day higher , intel $ intc lags $ mrk URL"". This seems to be a link to Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) data, specifically mentioning that Merck is leading and Intel is lagging. It looks like a news update related to the stock market with some context about competitors.

The second tweet: ""AT_USER $ mrk your tweet has been featured on market parse , for iphone . URL"". This mentions Merck again, perhaps indicating that someone likes or follows them, and it's linked to an iPhone. The word ""market parse"" might be a placeholder or typo, maybe meant to indicate a feature link.

So the key points are:

1. First tweet is about DJIA, showing Merck leads, Intel lags. This could mean that Merck has positive earnings, which can drive up the stock price.
2. Second tweet mentions Merck being featured on market parse and linked to an iPhone. Maybe it's a sign of growing interest or engagement with the company.

Looking at each factor:

- Positive: Mentioning DJIA with Merck leading could indicate positive news about the company. High earnings might boost the stock, which is a classic positive indicator.
- Negative: The fact that Intel lags in this context doesn't directly indicate negative sentiment unless it affects other factors like market performance or competition. However, if the overall market is doing well, even with Intel lagging, Merck's lead might still be positive.

Overall sentiment seems to lean towards a positive impact on the stock price. The user engagement from the second tweet suggests that people are more likely to engage with their opinions, but combined with Merck's performance in the first tweet, it reinforces the potential for an upward move."
2015-03-01,Missing,File not found
2015-03-02,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets will impact the stock price of a company and then classify them as positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol mentioned in the tweets: mrk. I remember that ""mrk"" is short for Meta Platforms Inc., which is known to be a leader in the cryptocurrency space. So the company we're analyzing here is likely related to crypto, maybe cryptocurrencies or the market capitalization of companies with similar names.

Now, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet says, ""rt AT_USER $ mrk will be presenting at the 35th annual cowenhealthcare conference : URL."" Hmm, this seems like it's promoting a presentation or talk on Meta. However, the word ""cowenhealthcare"" stands out to me. I'm not sure if that's related to Meta. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps it refers to another company? If it's about a healthcare conference, that might be relevant for discussing stock performance in that sector.

2. The second tweet is a placeholder: ""Output Requirement\nConclude with a single line that states the overall sentiment. Use one of the following tags exactly:\n[Positive]\n[Neutral]\n[Negative]""

Wait, that doesn't look right. It seems like it's supposed to be part of the analysis but isn't relevant. Maybe it was cut off or misformatted. Since I can't see the rest of this tweet, I might not be able to analyze its impact on the stock price.

Since I don't have complete information about the second tweet and some tweets are incomplete, maybe their content is too vague to assess their effect. However, in a real-world scenario, each tweet would provide specific details that could influence investor sentiment. But here, without more data, it's hard to determine if this tweet adds any useful info or just provides background.

Putting it all together, I know Meta is a significant company in the crypto space, but without concrete information from each tweet, my analysis might be limited. I'll focus on what I have and note that some tweets don't provide enough context for an accurate assessment."
2015-03-03,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol: $ mrk. I think that's Microsoft. Okay, so we're analyzing the sentiment towards Microsoft based on these tweets.

Now, each tweet is separate, and I need to analyze them one by one.

Starting with the first tweet: ""european stocks edge higher after spanish , german data ; dax up ... : URL"". Hmm, this seems like positive news about European markets. The mention of Spanish and German data suggests they have good economic reports or data releases. The DAX rising might indicate that European stock prices are doing well, which could be a good sign for Microsoft, especially if they're in a similar industry or sector.

The second tweet is from Twitter: ""the company went public on april 30th"". Going public usually means raising the offering price, so it's a positive signal. This might mean that management is making an announcement about expanding operations or improving financials, which could benefit the stock price positively.

So, combining these two tweets, both are pointing towards good news for Microsoft. The European market up, going public, and the DAX rising all contribute to an expectation of stronger performance. This makes me lean towards a positive sentiment overall."
2015-03-04,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of the provided tweets on the stock price of a company and determine whether it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at the tweet: ""remember when $ bmy gave up the lead in io to $ mrk ? 😂"". It seems like the user is recalling past interactions with BMY and mentioning its performance relative to MRK. The use of symbols ($) suggests a reference stock. The sentiment here is positive because it's a reassurance or reflection on past performance, which can sometimes be seen as an indicator of future expectations.

I don't see any negative terms, so maybe the impact isn't there. However, since BMY is mentioned, it could mean that the overall market perceives them positively regarding this stock segment. So, considering all factors—positive reinforcement from a previous interaction and the mention of symbols—it leans towards a positive overall sentiment."

2015-03-09,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user provided a set of tweets and an example output which is ""[Neutral]"". Let me walk through my thought process step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at each tweet, I notice that they all mention ""mrk"" but don't specify a particular stock. That's confusing because without knowing which company is being referred to, it's hard to assess the impact on any specific stock. But since the user mentioned it's for a given company, maybe in the example they are using a hypothetical company called MarkTRK or something like that. 

Next, I need to separate each tweet into positive and negative factors. Each tweet is only one sentence, but both seem to have similar sentiments: ""taking $ mrk 60 calls , apr 17th ."". So for the first tweet, it's about taking $mrk 60 calls on April 17th. I'll consider that as a positive factor because investing in a stock is generally seen as a positive thing by investors.

For the second tweet: ""mrk could be a good stock to buy"". This also seems positive because it suggests the stock might perform well, which can lead to gains for investors.

Now, assessing sentiment. Both tweets are addressing investor decisions related to the stock. The first is about taking options (60 calls), and the second is about whether to buy the stock. Each of these actions could positively influence investor sentiment, expecting higher trading volumes and potential gains. However, without knowing the company's fundamentals or broader market conditions, it's hard to be certain.

In combining the factors, both tweets are positive in their respective contexts but not necessarily in terms of overall impact on the stock price. They're just statements about possible actions by investors related to the stock, which can lead to expectations that might translate into higher stock prices, but this is speculative without more information.

So, considering all this, the sentiment isn't clear-cut. The impact on the stock could be positive if the company performs well and the sentiment leads to increased trading activity, but it's also possible that these tweets are just cues for investment decisions without a direct correlation with price movements. Therefore, the overall sentiment is neutral because we can't confidently say whether the stock will go up or down based solely on these tweets."
2015-03-10,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock price. I'm not very experienced in this, but I'll go through it step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ evrm closed up 83.67 % today ! special update : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"". It mentions EVRM and MRK as stocks. The second tweet is a retweet with several keywords like AT_USER, BMY, LLY, MRK, NVS, etc., along with URLs. So the main stocks here are EVRM and MRK.

Next, I need to break down each tweet into factors: positive and negative. For the first tweet, it mentions a significant price increase for EVRM, which is good because it could boost its stock value. The mention of URL breaking might be irrelevant unless it affects something else, but since it's about trading or stock updates, maybe not. Similarly, for MRK, it doesn't specify if there are positive or negative aspects mentioned.

Looking at the second tweet: It seems like it's a user message from someone updating on some companies (BMY, LLY, etc.), so again, focusing on EVRM and MRK as the main stocks. The retweet might be just amplifying the mention of these stocks without adding much sentiment information.

Assessing the sentiment for each tweet: The first one has a positive factor because it's showing strong news about a stock increase. The second is mainly a retweet, so no significant sentiment there unless implied by the context, which I don't think it provides clear sentiment data.

Combining these, the main factors are EVRM and MRK. The first tweet gives a boost for EVRM, but the second tweet doesn't mention any negative factors or strong positive ones beyond the initial news. So overall, it seems like there's some support towards EVRM, which might contribute to its stock price.

Therefore, considering that one tweet provides positive info about EVRM and the others are just retweets without significant sentiment, the overall impact is likely a slight positive effect on the stock."
2015-03-11,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of the given company. The target stock symbol is missing here, but I can still go through the process as if it were provided.

First, I need to identify the stock symbol from the tweets. Since each tweet ends with a URL that includes $ mrk $ pfe $ zgnx, which are common in stocks, I think these might be ticker symbols for specific companies. But without knowing exactly what those are, it's hard to determine. However, since they all end with these numbers and letters, maybe the stock symbol is something like ""mrk"" or ""pfe"". 

Next, looking at the tweets: both are just repeating ""good morning .. headlines & sunshine , too .. URL pharma $ mrk $ pfe $ zgnx statin …"". It seems repetitive and not adding any specific information. They're all just links and don't mention anything about the stock performance or events affecting it.

So, for each tweet:
- Factor is ""pharma"", ""pfe"" (which I'm assuming stands for Price), and ""zgnx"" which might be a product name like Zged. But since they didn't mention anything about the company's financials, earnings, or other indicators, it's hard to assess positive or negative factors.

Assessing sentiment: Each tweet is just repeating itself without any personal opinions or updates. They don't provide any new information that would affect investor sentiment. So, each tweet doesn't add value for predicting stock price changes.

Putting it all together, since none of the tweets give me relevant information about the company's performance or external factors like market news, trends, or product launches, I can't determine a positive, negative, or neutral impact on the stock. The overall sentiment remains [Neutral] because there's no data to suggest any trend.

I'll conclude with [Neutral] as that reflects no significant information affecting the stock price."
2015-03-12,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given tweets are likely to impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for a certain company. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. The tweets mention several companies going ex-dividends and short itm puts expiring soon. That could affect those specific stocks but not the ones mentioned in the tweets. So, I think the main focus is on those five companies: alb, df, ko, luk, mo, mrk.

Now, analyzing each tweet one by one:

1. ""several companies went ex-dividend today . watch out for early assignment of short itm puts going forward . $ alb $ df $ ko $ luk $ mo $ mrk""

This is a bit confusing because it says ""ex-dividend"" instead of ""ex-dividend."" Maybe that's just a typo, but the main points are about companies changing their stock prices and short-term payoffs expiring soon. So, if these companies are about to pay dividends or have payoffs ending soon, that could affect their stock prices.

But wait, I don't have specific information on each company. Without knowing which of alb, df, ko, luk, mo, mrk is the target, it's hard to assess their impact. But since this tweet is in response to an ex-dividend announcement, it might prompt investors to sell their shares because they're about to receive a dividend.

Hmm, but if it's about the company going ex-dividend, that usually means the stock price will drop slightly as shareholders are entitled to dividends. However, if there's an upcoming payoff for short put options, that could push the stock up in the short term before expiring.

So overall, I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment because investors might sell their shares expecting the dividend and hoping the stock doesn't dip too low immediately when payoffs expire."
2015-03-13,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying.

The first tweet says, ""merck $ mrk trading near $55.46 support level ( URL )"". Hmm, that looks like it's mentioning the price of Merck stock, which is a big name in the pharmaceutical industry. The number 55.46 seems familiar; I think that's the current price per share for Merck right now. 

Now, looking at the factors in each tweet: ""support level"" and ""( URL )"". Support level probably means that investors are waiting to see if the stock hits a resistance level before it breaks, which could indicate potential upside. The part about (URL) might be indicating a link or something else, but I'm not sure what it's referring to.

Since the stock is trading near $55.46 and the support level suggests it's moving higher, this could be positive news that buyers are looking for confirmation of their views. It also includes an image URL which doesn't add much information here, so maybe it's just a way to link the tweet or provide more context.

Putting it all together, the tweet is pointing towards a possible upward movement in Merck's stock price as support levels come into play. This could affect investor sentiment positively because potential buyers might be waiting for this level before deciding to buy shares. 

Wait, but does $55.46 represent current support? I know that Merck has been trading higher recently, so maybe the mention of it being near a certain price is part of confirming expectations. That would increase confidence in the stock's value and likely lead to a positive outcome.

However, sometimes stocks can come back after some periods even if they're just around the price level. It depends on how the market reacts. But given that it's mentioned as a support level, which implies it's about to go higher, I think this tweet is leaning towards a positive sentiment. So overall, it seems like the impact would be positive for the stock."
2015-03-14,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a list of tweets and an example output. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""what are general characteristics of different classes of direct-acting antiviral ? hcv $ gild $ abbv $ mrk $ bmy $ achn URL"". Hmm, it seems to be asking about Direct Antiviral Classes (DAs), which I think refer to treatments like HIV Inhibitors. The keywords here are HCV andABBV, so maybe the stock is related to these pharmaceutical companies.

Now, looking at each tweet individually:

1. ""what are general characteristics of different classes of direct-acting antiviral ? hcv $ gild $ abbv $ mrk $ bmy $ achn URL"" - This one's more like an introduction and seems to list some products. It might be unrelated or just explaining the stock's topic without specific info.
2. ""A new drug is on sale at great discounts!"" - This could mean that there are promotions, which is positive.
3. ""the company has been making big strides in its research for decades"" - Strongly positive because it shows progress and potential.

Wait, but I need to analyze each tweet. Let me re-examine the first one: It's listing drugs under different classes, so maybe stock related to that sector? But without more context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative. Similarly, the second tweet mentions sales discount, which is good for investor confidence.

But I think the user wants an overall sentiment based on all relevant tweets. So let me go through each one:

1. ""what are general characteristics of different classes of direct-acting antiviral ? hcv $ gild $ abbv $ mrk $ bmy $ achn URL"" - This is about drug classes, which could be good or neutral.
2. ""a new drug is on sale at great discounts!"" - Definitely positive as it suggests growth and potential for increased sales.
3. ""the company has been making big strides in its research for decades"" - Big strides mean likely positive sentiment.

So putting it all together: The first tweet might be introducing the stock but without more info, neutral. The second is clearly positive about discounts. The third is also positive about their research. So overall sentiment seems Positive."
2015-03-15,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a tweet about short sales for three stocks: $ qiwi , $ aapl (which is Apple), $ swks and $ uwti (which I think stands for U-Triange Corporation). The task is to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock prices of the given company, which in this case seems to be Apple Inc. since it's one of the stocks mentioned.

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying. The tweet says ""$ qiwi short sales updated Sunday, March 15, 2015 04:03 : 13 am $ aapl $ swks $ uwti URL"". Hmm, this seems a bit confusing with all those symbols and dates. It looks like the user might have made a typo or misplaced some information.

I'm not sure what ""qiwi"" refers to. Maybe it's a placeholder for an actual stock symbol or something else entirely. The other stocks mentioned are Apple (A), U-Triange Corporation (UT), and possibly another company represented by ""swks"". 

Since the tweet is about short sales updating, I need to figure out if this affects Apple's performance. Short sales being updated could indicate changes in investor behavior regarding short-term positions. More information on short sales can sometimes affect stock prices because it shows investors' confidence or risk tolerance.

Given that the tweet doesn't specify whether there was an increase or decrease in short sales, I might have to assume based on context. If short sales are increasing, perhaps due to more investors buying protection from rising stock prices, it could signal some underlying positive news, which might benefit Apple's stock price.

However, without concrete information about what happened with the short sales (if there was a rise or fall), it's challenging to determine the sentiment definitively. If the user is referring to specific stocks like U-Triange, their performance would depend on factors like market conditions, company-specific events, or economic indicators related to that area.

Also, since Apple isn't mentioned in this tweet, I'm not sure how relevant it is to its stock price impact. Maybe there's a typo and the actual tweets are about different stocks, but based solely on this single tweet, it's hard to make an accurate assessment.

Considering all this uncertainty, my conclusion should probably be neutral. Without clear information or context from other tweets, I can't confidently label the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral for Apple Inc. If there were more tweets related to this company, that would provide better clarity. As it stands, based solely on the given tweet, I have to assume it's a bit ambiguous and thus report a neutral stance."
2015-03-16,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price. I see the target is an S&P 500 index stock symbol, but in the output requirements, there's no specific information given about which stock. Hmm, maybe it's a general analysis for any S&P 500 stock.

Looking at the tweets: The first tweet mentions the FDA panel meeting on May 12 to discuss Ebola vaccines, with some symbols like jnj, gsk, mrk, nlnk. These seem like company names. Since these are separate from the target stock, I can't directly assess their impact unless they relate to the company.

So, without knowing which specific stock, it's hard to say if the FDA meeting is positive or negative for that stock. It might affect the overall market but not the individual stock itself. If there were no mention of a specific stock symbol, maybe the user wants a general analysis across all stocks in the S&P 500.

I should probably note that without the target stock, I can't provide a precise sentiment. But since the task is to conclude with one tag—Positive, Neutral, or Negative—I have to make an assumption here. Perhaps the FDA meeting related to medical devices or vaccines could influence certain sectors more than others. Maybe it's neutral if it doesn't relate to specific stocks, but I'm not entirely sure.

I think the best course of action is to conclude that without knowing the target stock, it's neutral because we can't determine the impact on a single stock. Alternatively, maybe the tweet is about something unrelated and thus has no effect, which would be negative if considering broader market effects, but that doesn't make sense in this context.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. If the user wants an analysis for any S&P 500 stock, but each tweet refers to a different one, then it's impossible to assess sentiment without knowing the target stock. Therefore, perhaps the answer is neutral because there's no specific information about which stock or its performance.

I think that's a reasonable approach. Without a specific stock name, we can't determine if the tweet positively or negatively impacts any particular company."
2015-03-17,Missing,File not found
2015-03-18,Missing,File not found
2015-03-19,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of each tweet on the stock price of a given company. Let's see, the target stock symbol is biib.com. 

The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER some important data around the corner for all of these bios $ biib $ mrk and others."" The user mentions important data for both biib.com (biIB) and mrk. I'm not sure what mrk stands for, but it's a common abbreviation. It seems like there are updates relevant to these companies. If investors expect more information or data about both, they might become more confident in their stock performance. This could lead to positive sentiment. But wait, could there be any negative implications? Maybe if the user is acting honestly or if the company is involved with something that's risky. Hmm, not sure.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER some important data around the corner for all of these bios $ biib $ mrk and others."" Wait, this seems identical to the first one except in lowercase. I need to check if it's a copy-paste mistake or intentional. If it's redundant, it might not add much. It could just be there as a typo, so probably not providing new information.

The third tweet: ""rt AT_USER some important data around the corner for all of these bios $ biib $ mrk and others."" Again, identical to the first two. Another copy-paste issue here. Maybe it's an attempt at creating multiple tweets but not really contributing anything meaningful.

In the output requirement, I need to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"" based on the analysis of these tweets. Each tweet is repetitive, which might be a mistake. However, considering that both other tweets are just variations, the overall sentiment remains positive because there's some data being mentioned that could be relevant and possibly good for investors.

But wait, if all three tweets are the same except in different cases, they're essentially redundant. So each tweet is not adding new information but repeating the same content. It might just be a mistake on their part, leading to no significant impact. Therefore, I'd say the sentiment remains neutral because there's no genuine data affecting the stock price.

Alternatively, if these tweets are meant to attract attention or provide context that could help investors make decisions without causing confusion, maybe it's slightly positive. But given they're repetitive, it leans towards not having a significant effect.

So my conclusion is [Neutral]."
2015-03-20,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock price. So, I'm given two tweets here and need to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for a company's future stock price.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. The first tweet says ""this service made 20,000 % gains in the last month ! subscribe here URL .. breakout $ insy $ mrk"". That mentions a significant percentage gain and specific company names: Insy and Mrk. I'm not sure if that's the actual stock name or something else, but the main factors seem to be positive percentages and possibly subscriptions related to these companies.

In the second tweet, ""Negative feedback is everywhere on my account. Maybe it's just a bug or something needs fixing."" That sounds pretty negative with negative sentiment towards their account. Subscriptions again for Insy and Mrk. So, both tweets are talking about the service but one has positive comments and the other negative.

Now, breaking down each tweet. The first one talks about 20,000% gains – that's a strong indicator of good performance, which is positive. But it also mentions subscriptions and potential future purchases. High growth in the past could indicate confidence, so that's a mix of positive and neutral factors.

The second tweet is clearly negative. Negative feedback might mean customers are unhappy or dissatisfied with their account. Since they're subscriptions-based, negative sentiments could affect retention and future revenue. This seems like it's pushing towards a negative sentiment.

Combining both tweets: One is positive but overhyped, while the other is very negative. The high percentage gains in the first tweet could be a bit mixed, but overall, the overall sentiment might lean towards [Neutral] because one tweet is clearly positive and another is clearly negative."
2015-03-21,Negative,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Merck & Co. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the task is to analyze a tweet about Merck's stock and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative for their future stock price. The tweet provided is: ""merck & co . inc . ( mrk ) closes 0.97 % up on the day for march 19 $ mrk url""

Looking at the tweet, I can see that it starts by mentioning Merck and co., which is the company's symbol. Then it says their stock closed up by 0.97% on March 19th, provided by mrk.

I need to break this down into factors. The positive factor here is the news that the stock price went up. That suggests good news for investors, which would likely increase the stock price. There's no negative information mentioned in the tweet, so I don't see any factors like earnings reports or other bad news related to Merck.

In terms of sentiment analysis, the user is only providing one tweet here, and that positive movement from March 19th. Without more context about past trends or recent performance, it's hard to say if this momentum will continue. It could be a short-term gain, but it doesn't give a clear overall picture.

So considering all the factors—only a positive price increase which might indicate confidence in their products and market position—it seems like the sentiment is positive for now. There’s no doubt that there has been some improvement, so I think this tweet leans towards a positive outcome."
2015-03-22,Missing,File not found
2015-03-23,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock market and determine their impact on the future stock price. 

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk 200 dma rejection , top of the channel , spectacular rvr for a short . URL"". Hmm, it seems like this tweet is about MrK stock, which probably stands for ""Mr. K"", a company that has been struggling financially recently. The phrase mentions a ""200 dma rejection"" – I think that might be a typo or a reference to the Dow Jones Industrial Average index dropping by 20 points. Then it says ""top of the channel,"" which could mean that MrK is on top of some trading platform, like a stock exchange. The mention of a ""sp spectacular rvr for a short"" sounds exciting – maybe it's referring to a significant event related to the company, perhaps an earnings call or a major news event.

Now, considering how these tweets are being shared and read by investors, the user is trying to update their trading position from long to short. They're probably betting that MrK will recover quickly after some losses. So, each tweet is a positive signal towards a potential rise in the stock price.

The second tweet: ""$ mrk $ retest 200 dma , top of the channel . lower ebitda numbers"" seems to be related again to MrK. The ""retest 200 dma"" likely indicates that MrK's financial performance has improved, maybe better-than-expected EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization). This is a positive sign because lower EBITDA numbers often come with higher interest expenses or operational inefficiencies. So, if the company is recovering and reporting better earnings despite potential costs, it's a good momentum indicator.

Putting these together, both tweets are reinforcing that MrK is improving and looking to recover quickly. Investors might be shifting their positions from ""don't trade"" to buying stock given this optimistic outlook. The combination of positive financial statements and the user's trading move could lead to an increase in demand for MrK shares.

I also need to consider if there are any other factors like news about regulations, economic indicators, or industry trends. But based on the tweets provided, it seems focused solely on MrK's financial performance and market position. 

In conclusion, with both positive mentions of improved financials and a shift in trading stance, this analysis leans towards a positive overall sentiment."
2015-03-24,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets will positively, neutrally, or negatively affect the stock price of a company. The user provided four tweets and asked me to analyze them using a specific method.

First, I'll look at each tweet one by one and extract relevant information. Let's see:

1. "" $ hlf news : 5 stocks moving on news $ abmd $ bmy $ hlf $ mrk $ sons "" URL quote : URL
   - The main word here is ""hlf,"" which might refer to something like dividend yield or a specific stock ticker.
2. Same as the first one: "" $ bmy $ mrk news : 5 stocks moving on news $ abmd $ bmy $ hlf $ mrk $ sons ""
3. "" merck says melanoma drug meets goal ; study halted $ mrk URL
   - This tweet mentions that Merck's melanoma drug meets their goal and talks about a study being halted.
4. "" rt AT_USER merck announces new $ 10b stock repurchase program . $ mrk""

Now, I need to identify the target stock symbol. It seems like 'mrk' is repeating, so maybe that's the company name or ticker.

Next step is to separate each tweet into positive and negative factors. For example, if a tweet says a company is meeting their goal, it could be neutral if it just achieves something but not necessarily positively impacting. Alternatively, if a study is halted after meeting a goal, it might lean towards negative because the outcome isn't as expected.

Sentiment analysis: I'll assess how each tweet affects investor sentiment. Positive tweets usually increase stock prices, while negative ones decrease them or leave them neutral.

So for the first two tweets, they mention 5 stocks moving on news with other companies listed. This could indicate that these stocks are performing well because more companies are citing this as a fact. It might suggest some positive outlook but without specific details on how it affects the target stock 'mrk', I'm not sure.

The third tweet says Merck's melanoma drug meets their goal and talks about a study being halted. If the goal is achieved, maybe there's an expectation of better performance from Merck. But if the study was halted after meeting the goal, that could be seen as a negative because they might have expected better results.

The fourth tweet mentions a repurchase program. If Merck is buying back stock, it can sometimes signal investor confidence in their future prospects, which might be positive.

Putting this together: The third tweet shows some expectation of improvement but also an anticipated change in results. The fourth one directly affects the company's actions. But without knowing what 'mrk' refers to, I can't say for sure if these affect its stock price positively or not.

Overall, it seems like there are mixed signals—some positive expectations and potential negative outcomes. However, since the user didn't specify the target stock, it's hard to pin down a clear overall sentiment."
2015-03-25,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a given company, and then conclude whether it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, let me look at each tweet separately. The target stock is identified as ""mrk"". 

Looking at the first tweet: It says ""options expected to be active AT_USER $ krft $ mdlz $ pep $ ko $ sjm $ k $ gis rht $ lulu $ bbry $ mrk"". The term ""options"" suggests that it's involved with a stock option trading, which could mean some kind of investment decision. The fact that it mentions various stocks like mdlz, pep, etc., indicates a broad exposure or interest in those companies, but it doesn't explicitly state if this is positive, neutral, or negative for mrk.

The second tweet says ""$ mrk apr . 17 , 2015 call 59.00 : +5.875 contracts add to oi"". Here, ""mrk"" is mentioned along with a stock price and the change in contracts (contracts). The term ""add to oi"" seems like a typo; probably meant ""add to oi"" as part of the contract terms or something else, but it's unclear. It could mean that mrk was trading higher, which might indicate an upward movement.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's impact on mrk. The first tweet is discussing options and potential investments, so while it shows interest in mrk, it doesn't specify if it's a positive or negative signal. The second tweet talks about contracts, which could be part of stock trading operations but again, without clear sentiment, it's ambiguous.

However, the overall impact is based on these factors. The first tweet has some context about options and investments, which can sometimes go either way. The second tweet mentions a rise in contracts, suggesting increased trading activity or interest. If both tweets are positive indicators of increased interest or investment, it could lead to an upward trend.

But since neither tweet explicitly states a positive or negative sentiment towards mrk, the overall impact is likely neutral. The presence of multiple factors suggests uncertainty about the stock's performance."
2015-03-26,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out how they impact the stock price of a company. The tweet list provided has four entries, and each mentions different stocks with specific keywords or actions.

Let me start by breaking down each tweet one by one.

1. ""mrk 4q14 call – ken , ceo : past year allowed us to return approx . $ 13bil to shareholders through our dividend & share repurchases ."" This looks like a news release from Merck, probably mentioning their performance metrics and dividends. This is positive because it's about the company's financial results.

2. ""what does merck's $ 10b buyback plan say about pharma m & a ? url $ mrk pharma by AT_USER"" So this tweet is asking about a buyback plan they mentioned. It seems like they're discussing whether their buybacks are part of a larger strategy, which could impact future stock price as it might affect their dividend policy.

3. ""weekly dow stocks trend $ mcd $ mrk $ pfe $ nke $ vz $ unh $ trv $ cvx $ dis $ hd $ ibm $ utx $ ba $ ko $ xom $ aapl $ pg $ jnj @ url"" This tweet is about the Dow Jones Industrial Average and mentions several stock tickers. It seems neutral because it's describing current trends without any specific positive or negative information.

4. ""$ aal $ mrk : melting stocks - american airlines group ( aal ) , merck ( mrk ... : url"" Again, this looks like Merck's financial report with a mention of American Airlines Group. Positive since it's about their performance and dividends.

Now, considering the overall sentiment. The first tweet is positive because it shows good results. The second tweet is neutral as it's speculative but doesn't provide strong info. The third is also neutral for the same reason. The fourth is positive for another reason. 

But wait, there are conflicting positives and a neutral one. However, each tweet is about Merck, which often has strong performance in the pharmaceutical sector. So combining these, they seem to support Merck's continued success.

Therefore, I'll conclude with ""[Positive]"" because there's a solid positive outlook based on their recent financial statements."
2015-03-27,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The target is GSK. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: AT_USER selling spread to big-cap pharma as well yesterday. I'm not sure what ""spread"" means here; maybe it's a way to distribute profits or something else. Either way, they're selling a spread related to GSK stock. That sounds like a positive signal because it could be good news for investors.

Second tweet: RT AT_USER cdc getting to zero w / ebola URL nih who barda niaid $ gsk $ mrk $ nlnk $ jnj zmapp pharma. I'm noticing words like ebola and niaid, which are health-related terms. Maybe the company is preparing for an upcoming health crisis or has some health-focused projects. If they're preparing for something, that might be a positive outlook.

Third tweet: RT AT_USER $ mrk announces collaboration with AT_USER to educate diabetic adults about risk for certain diseases : URL. This looks like a marketing campaign. They're collaborating with another company on educational efforts specifically targeting diabetics. Such announcements can attract more investors because it shows the company is committed to public health and expanding their reach.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet gives positive news, second suggests they're in good shape post-crisis, and third indicates marketing expansion. All of these indicate good business prospects and increased investor confidence."
2015-03-28,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided two tweets and wants me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to look at each tweet individually and then combine them into an overall analysis.

The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER ken burns cancer biography begins airing mar 30 . $ bmy $ mrk $ juno $ kite $ rhhby URL."" So, looking at this, it seems like there's some mention of a blog post about Ken Burns' cancer diagnosis. It also mentions various companies: bmy, mrk, juno, kite, and rhhby.

I think the main point here is that the blog could be related to the company's performance or maybe their marketing strategy. If the article is positive and relates positively to the company, it might boost investor confidence, leading to a positive impact on the stock price. But if the content is negative, investors might get worried and sell off the stock.

Now, looking at the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER ken burns cancer biography begins airing mar 30 . $ bmy $ mrk $ juno $ kite $ rhhby URL."" Wait, this looks similar to the first one. It's repeating some information from the previous tweet. Both tweets are mentioning a blog about Ken Burns and some companies.

So both tweets are essentially stating that there's a planned blog post on Ken Burns related to these companies. Since they're just repeating each other's statements, I can't get any new information here. They don't offer any positive or negative insights about the company.

Therefore, combining both tweets doesn't provide any new data points that could influence the stock price. The content isn't giving me any details on how this blog will impact the company's performance or overall financial health. It just seems to be a repetition of the same information twice.

As for sentiment analysis, since there's no new info, I can't really assess whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. The tweets are more about news than anything else. They're not discussing the stock directly but are rather spreading unrelated content.

So, putting it all together: Both tweets are just repeating each other, so they don't provide any specific information that would affect the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively. Therefore, I should conclude that there's no impact on the stock price."
2015-03-29,Missing,File not found
2015-03-30,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given tweets will have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of a company. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""our penny stock newsletter picks gained over 1485 % ! huge update : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". Hmm, it says ""URL stocks"", but that doesn't give me a specific stock name. Maybe I need to assume something or maybe see if there's another way to extract the symbol.

Wait, looking again, maybe the symbols are just part of the text: ""mrk"" and ""lgnd"". That might be 'MSFT' (Microsoft) and 'LND' which could be LND stock. But without knowing the exact company, it's tricky. Maybe I can assume that these are related to Microsoft or LND as stocks.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. The first tweet says ""gained over 1485 %"". That sounds like a massive positive news about the stock. It mentions a newsletter pick, which suggests excitement. Also, it's updating their URL with more info on stocks. 

So, for this tweet, Positive factors might include excitement from big gains and major updates. The negative part could be anything that contradicts the positive, but nothing stands out.

Overall sentiment is pretty clear here—positive. So the overall impact should be [Positive].

I think I'm confident with that conclusion because the main points are about gaining a lot and more information being provided."
2015-03-31,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price for a given company. Let me start by analyzing each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""aacr 15 class i hdac inhib upregulates pd - 1 ligands in melanoma & increases efficacy of pd - 1 blockade . URL $ mrk / syndax""

Hmm, this one mentions something about a drug being inhibited and using certain ligands. That sounds like it might be related to a medical treatment, possibly cancer therapy. If this is positive for the company's product development or business growth, it could boost their stock. But I'm not sure if it directly affects the future price of a specific company unless there's context about the company.

Second tweet: ""mrk / syndax"" – Wait, I don't recognize this abbreviation. Maybe it's a typo? It seems like it might refer to a subscription service or something else, but without more context, it's hard to tell how it affects the stock price.

Third tweet: The first one is from the previous response, which I think is similar to the first tweet about medical treatments. If both tweets are about products that positively impact their business, especially in a competitive market, they could contribute positively.

I'm not sure what specific company these tweets refer to since the symbol isn't given. Without knowing who mrk and syndax are, it's challenging. But assuming they're part of a group or industry, if their performance is positive, that might tie into the stock.

So overall, without more information about the company or its competition, I can't be certain. If each tweet is positive for their product, especially in a competitive market, it could have a positive impact. But if there's uncertainty about how these tweets align with their core business, it might be neutral.

Maybe the best approach is to consider that while both mentions are about products being improved, without knowing their relevance to the company, I can't confidently label them as positive or negative. It might depend on broader market trends and sector-specific news."
2015-04-01,Negative,"Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided a tweet and asked me to determine its likely impact on the future stock price of a company. Hmm, wait, but the actual stock symbol isn't given in the tweet. That's confusing. Maybe it's part of the process? Let me check the initial instructions.

The user provided a set of tweets to analyze. Each tweet seems to be mentioning various factors like mergers, financial performance, etc., and mentions companies like Teva and PFE. But since there's only one tweet here without a stock symbol, I might not have enough information. Maybe the user expects me to figure it out or assume a default? Alternatively, perhaps each tweet corresponds to a different stock, but the given one is just an example.

Wait, actually, looking back at the problem statement: The user provided a specific tweet and wants an analysis leading to a single output tag. So maybe the target stock isn't specified, but since the user provided a tweet without it, perhaps I'm supposed to infer based on the content? Or maybe each tweet represents one factor for different stocks.

But in this case, the given tweet is about various factors affecting Teva's operations or future prospects. It mentions things like mergers and other financial activities. So maybe the stock is related to a company mentioned here, perhaps Teva or PFE, but without knowing which one, it's tricky.

Wait, actually, looking at the initial problem statement again: The user provided a set of tweets and wants me to determine their impact on the future stock price of a given company. But in the output requirement, they only expect a single tag. So maybe each tweet corresponds to a different stock? Or perhaps all the tweets together represent the factors for one company?

Wait, no, in the example provided earlier, there were multiple tweets about different companies with their own factors. So I think each tweet is about a specific company's factors. But here, only one tweet is given. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the single tweet refers to multiple companies? Or perhaps it's not an actual stock but a combination of factors for one company. I'm getting confused. Maybe I should proceed by assuming that this single tweet is part of a set where each tweet corresponds to different stocks. But without knowing which stock each tweet refers to, I can't determine the overall impact on any specific stock.

Wait, perhaps the user intended to provide multiple tweets but combined them into one line. That might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's an example with multiple tweets leading to a conclusion about the stock price impact of all the factors mentioned in that set of tweets. But since only one tweet is given without a stock symbol, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps each letter in the word ""tweet"" corresponds to different stocks? Like 't', 'w', 'e', 'e' for four separate tweets? That seems possible. Let me check: 'Teva' is a company mentioned in some tweets here, but not all. The given tweet mentions several other companies as well.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Since the user provided only one tweet without a stock symbol and asked to analyze it, perhaps that's an error. Maybe they meant each letter corresponds to different stocks? Or perhaps I should consider that each of these is part of a larger set, but since only one is given here, it's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe this single tweet represents all the information needed for multiple companies. For example, Teva has several factors mentioned in this tweet: mergers & financials. Then, PFE and other companies have their own factors. So perhaps each factor applies to different stocks, making it impossible to know without context.

But since the problem statement is a bit unclear, I think I should proceed by assuming that this single tweet contains information about multiple stocks, but without knowing which ones, it's not possible to assess their impact on stock price. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in providing only one tweet instead of an array or multiple tweets.

Wait, looking back at the initial instructions: ""Analyze the provided tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a given company."" But each tweet is separate, so perhaps it's about different stocks. However, without knowing which ones, I can't make a determination.

Hmm, maybe the user wants me to consider all these factors together and decide whether they collectively indicate positive, neutral, or negative sentiment for any particular stock. But again, without knowing which stock each factor applies to, it's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps there's only one tweet about a single stock, but the way it's phrased makes it ambiguous. For example, ""rt AT_USER $ icel $ hznp $ hptx $ teva $ aspx merger ... psoriasis eczema..."" It doesn't specify which company. Teva is mentioned with specific financials like mergers and other factors.

Wait a minute, maybe the target stock isn't part of the tweet but is implied by some other logic? Or perhaps it's about each letter in ""tweet"" representing different stocks: T, W, E, E... No, that doesn't make sense either. Maybe it's a mistake to have only one tweet.

Given this uncertainty, I think I should proceed under the assumption that there are multiple tweets provided, each corresponding to a factor for a specific stock. But since in the problem statement, I was given only one tweet without a target stock symbol, perhaps it's part of a larger set where all factors together impact a particular stock.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to provide several tweets but combined them incorrectly into a single line. Without more context, it's hard to proceed accurately. So, considering that, perhaps I should inform the user or clarify if there are multiple tweets meant to be analyzed for a specific stock.

But since the initial output requires me to decide based on the given tweet alone, and without knowing which stock it refers to, I think I might need to make an educated guess or assume a default. However, that's not ideal.

Wait, perhaps each letter in ""tweet"" corresponds to different stocks? Like 'T', 'w', 'e', 'e' representing Teva, Wells Fargo & Co., etc.? But again, without knowing which one is being referred to, it's impossible to determine the overall impact on a stock price. It seems like this approach isn't working.

I think I might need to conclude that with the given information, I can't accurately determine the impact on any particular stock because each tweet refers to multiple factors for different companies without specifying which one is being discussed. Therefore, my answer would be ""Negative,"" but that's not helpful as it doesn't provide clarity.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have multiple tweets each about a different stock, and this single tweet is just part of the set. In that case, I might need more information. But based on what's provided, I can only analyze from one perspective without knowing which stock to focus on.

I think I've hit a wall here. Without the target stock symbol or additional context, it's impossible to assess the impact accurately. Maybe I should inform the user about this uncertainty and explain my limitations."
2015-04-02,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of a company and then determine whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I should identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ act , $ teva , $ mrk , $ lly , $ bmy cash from operations trend comparison chart : URL"". Hmm, that's a bit confusing because ""act"" and ""teva"" might be company names. Maybe I can infer that it's about ""Mrk"", which is the S&P 500 index component ETF, or maybe something else. But without more context, it's hard to pinpoint exactly. The second tweet has several words like ""stock options 101"", so perhaps it's referring to a specific stock.

Wait, actually, let me check again. The first tweet lists several symbols separated by commas: $ act, $ teva, $ mrk, $ lly, $ bmy. Then there are URLs with various words. Maybe the target is Mrk or another S&P ETF? But without knowing which one, I can't be sure.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. The first tweet mentions ""cash from operations"" and a chart about trend comparison. That's definitely looking good because it shows profitability. So that would be a positive factor.

The second tweet is a video package offer with the word ""stock options."" Stock options are financial instruments giving the right to buy stock at a specific price, which can increase demand and thus might have some positive aspects like higher risk or potential return. However, I also see mentions of several companies: $ wfm, $ ko, $ mrk, etc., so maybe it's related to those? ""mrk"" again could be S&P 500 ETF. The offer is free, which might attract more investors.

But wait, the user provided specific tweets but didn't specify the stock. Maybe I should assume that one of these symbols is the target stock. Let's say if it's about $ mrk (S&P 500), which is a widely referenced index.

So for the first tweet: It seems to be talking about financial performance, showing cash from operations and a comparison chart. That's positive.

For the second tweet: It's offering stock options as a free video package. Stock options can be a significant factor in investor sentiment because they offer potential gains but also require paying dividends or maintaining a margin account. Free options might attract more investors, which could be positive. However, I'm not sure if it's all positive.

Putting it together: The first tweet is definitely positive with good financial metrics. The second tweet is offering something valuable (options) for free, which might boost sentiment positively. So overall, the stock seems to have a positive impact because of these factors."
2015-04-03,Missing,File not found
2015-04-04,Positive,"Alright, let me tackle this query step by step. The user has provided four tweets and asked to determine their likely impact on the stock price using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at each tweet:

1. "" $ thcz is one of the best penny stocks with over 700 % gains in 2 months ! huge news : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd""
   - The symbols mentioned here are MRK and LGND.

Wait, hold on. Each symbol is written separately. So maybe I need to check if any symbols repeat or form a word. ""MRK"" could be Martin Schmiller-Knorr and ""LGND"" might be another company. Alternatively, it's possible the user made a typo and meant ""URL"", which isn't a known stock.

2. ""$ thcz is one of the best penny stocks with over 700 % gains in 2 months ! huge news : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd""
   - Same as above; probably MRK and LGND again.

3. The user didn't provide a third tweet, so I might need to infer or assume another stock, but that could be risky. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo in the formatting. Let me see if there are other tweets provided. Wait, looking back, only two tweets are given: the first one is the same as above.

Hmm, perhaps the user intended for each tweet to have separate symbols? But in this case, both tweets mention MRK and LGND. I'm not sure what those stocks are or their current status.

Next, I need to parse each tweet into factors. The process involves separating positive and negative factors. For each tweet, I should identify which parts are positive and which are negative. Then, assess the sentiment based on overall analysis.

Starting with the first tweet: "" $ thcz is one of the best penny stocks with over 700 % gains in 2 months ! huge news : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd""

From this, it's clear that MRK and LGND are mentioned. I need to determine their current state. If these are penny stocks (trading at under $1 per share) and have seen significant gains, they could be undervalued. That would support a positive sentiment.

But since the user provided only two tweets, maybe each is independent? Or perhaps it's a typo in the formatting of multiple symbols from the same tweet. Maybe ""URL"" is another symbol, but without context, I'm not sure.

Assuming that each line after $ represents separate factors, the first tweet says thcz is a penny stock with 700% gains over two months, so it's very strong. URL stocks are mentioned as well, which might be a typo for ""MRK"". So likely, both MRK and LGND are in focus.

Assuming MRK has seen significant gains, that would imply a positive impact on the stock price. Similarly, if URL (if it's another company) is performing well, that could add to the positive sentiment.

Therefore, considering both stocks, especially if they're penny stocks with strong performance, this tweet seems to be reinforcing a positive outlook."
2015-04-05,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the target company. The user provided three tweets and specified using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"" as possible responses.

First, let me identify the target stock from each tweet. 

1. The first tweet mentions ""mrk"" and includes ""aprildogs with merck URL."" This seems to be a typo because ""aprildogs"" is not a stock symbol. Maybe it's supposed to be something else like ""apl"" or another stock, but without more context, I'll assume the target is "" mrk "", which I believe stands for Microsoft. I'm not entirely sure about that, so this could affect my analysis.

2. The second tweet has similar content as the first one and again mentions ""aprildogs with merck URL."" This is confusing because it's using the same information but maybe rephrased or different terms. I'll note that both tweets are duplicates of each other, which might mean redundant information about Microsoft.

3. The third tweet discusses ""uvxy reviews updated"" on April 4, 2015 at 11:07 am and mentions ""dis"", ""mrk"", and ""cmg URL."" ""Dis"" likely refers to Disney, ""mrk"" again Microsoft, and ""cmg"" could be a typo for ""cmo."" This tweet is talking about reviews from a company called UVAxy, but I don't recognize this as an actual stock. It doesn't seem relevant to Microsoft's performance.

Now, breaking down each tweet:

1. The first tweet talks about a 11.21% advantage over Dow Jones' highest yield and lowest price in April. This could indicate positive news for the company, especially if they are comparing their performance against the market. But I'm not sure how significant this is without context on the stock's current position.

2. The second tweet is a repeat of the first one, so it reinforces that information. It still mentions a 11.21% advantage over Dow Jones, which might suggest positive sentiment about Microsoft's performance relative to their peers.

3. The third tweet discusses reviews from UVAxy but doesn't provide specific information relevant to Microsoft or its stock price changes.

Considering the overall tweets are duplicates and only mention Disney and other unrelated companies, they don't seem to directly affect Microsoft's stock price. Therefore, without any explicit positive or negative indicators pointing to Microsoft, it seems neutral.

I should also check if ""aprildogs"" is a typo for another symbol like ""apl."" If it were ""apl,"" that could be part of the stock symbol, but even so, without knowing its status as a stock, I can't assess positively or negatively. 

Given all this, each tweet is reinforcing the 11.21% advantage over Dow Jones, which might suggest positive trends but doesn't provide enough concrete information about Microsoft's actual performance or news related to it."
2015-04-06,Neutral,"Okay, let me figure out how to analyze this tweet about the stock performance. The tweet says, ""mrk received a new alert. find out why at url stocks daytrading trading mkt nyse nasdaq markets 349."" So, first, I need to identify what's in the tweet.

The word 'mrk' stands for Microsoft, which is a big company. They receive an alert indicating they're about to perform well on the stock market. The information given includes things like stocks, daytrading, trading platforms, NYSE, NASDAQ. These are all key components of a company's stock performance.

Next, I need to separate Positive and Negative factors. The tweet is more about receiving a new alert rather than making predictions or analyses. It doesn't mention specific details about why the alert was issued or any positive or negative information related to Microsoft's performance. So both factors seem neutral here because there's no explicit positive or negative indication.

Assessing the sentiment, since it's just a notification and not an opinion, the overall sentiment is neutral. There's no expectation of a positive or negative outcome from this tweet.

Looking at the output requirement, I have to conclude with one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since there are neither strong positives nor negatives mentioned, the best fit here is Neutral."
2015-04-07,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for the stock price impact on mrk. So, I see there are three tweets here. Let me go through each one step by step.

First tweet: ""AT_USER your tweet about $ mrk had a sentiment of 2 and was featured on market parse . URL"". Okay, so this seems pretty straightforward. It mentions that the user wrote a tweet about $mrk with a sentiment score of 2. Sentiment scores can vary from -1 to +5 or sometimes just -3 to +7, depending on the platform. A score of 2 is definitely positive because it's above zero, which usually means strong or favorable sentiment.

The second tweet is similar: ""AT_USER $ mrk your tweet has been featured on market parse , for iphone . URL"". Again, it says the sentiment was 2 and was featured. So another positive indication that the user found the tweet useful or important enough to be featured by market parses. This reinforces the previous positive sentiment.

Third tweet is a bit different: ""arvinas lands $ mrk partnership to develop protein degraders URL via AT_USER"". Here, it's about an upcoming partnership. The word ""lands"" might indicate that arvinas is taking on mrk as part of their operations or investment. The mention of the partnership and the URL (which I assume could be a landing page or official announcement) suggests they're collaborating with arvinas to develop something related to degraders, maybe for a product or project. This seems like it's positive because it indicates collaboration and potential growth opportunities.

Now, putting this together. Each tweet is reinforcing each other. The user is pointing out that mrk has certain metrics (sentiment score of 2) which are already being featured on market parses. Additionally, they're suggesting a partnership with arvinas to develop something related to degraders, which could indicate future growth or expansion in the company.

Sentiment-wise, all three tweets are positive. Each one is boosting the sentiment towards mrk and pointing towards potential positive impact. The user is giving solid information that points to strong prospects for the stock price. There's no negative or neutral language here; everything is constructive and encouraging.

I don't see any negative elements mentioned. No worries, big earnings, bad news, or anything like that. All of these tweets are about positive developments that could benefit the stock. So, combining all this, it looks like mrk is likely to perform well.

Therefore, the overall sentiment should be positive because each tweet is providing valuable information that suggests strong potential for the stock price."
2015-04-08,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of Merck & Co. Inc., which has the symbol mrk. The user wants me to analyze each tweet and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative in terms of impact on the stock price.

First, let's look at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ mrk gets two new breakthrough therapy designations in hcv : for genotype 1 w end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , and g …"". Hmm, this seems to be about receiving new therapies. Therapy usually can have a positive impact because it might improve patients' conditions, which could lead to better recovery rates and possibly higher demand for the company's products. That sounds like a positive sentiment.

Next, the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER new $ mrk hcv data show high cure rates ' as expected , ' db's robyn k says ; lowers $ gild market share est to 60 % longterm from …"". This one mentions that Merck's cure rates are high and mentions a decrease in their GILID stock price. If the company is showing strong performance, investors might expect higher growth or perhaps expectations of positive changes. This suggests a slight negative impact because it could signal confidence in future performance.

The third tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ mrk btd in ckd &gt4 probably implies 2 ndas : 1for btd populations & 1 for general gt1 indication . AT_USER"". Here, the tweet is talking about new therapy designs being approved for cKD and GT-1 indications. Therapy approvals can positively affect a company by increasing their market presence and potentially leading to higher demand or better pricing of their products. This again points towards a positive impact.

Lastly, the fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER mrk closes 0.44 % up on the day for april 7 $ mrk url"". The closing price increased by 0.44%. While stock prices can fluctuate based on news and market trends, an increase typically isn't classified as positive or negative unless it's a significant move that changes investor sentiment. In this case, it's a small percentage change but still upward, so I'll consider this as positive.

Now, summarizing the impacts:
1. Positive ( Therapy approvals )
2. Slight negative (下调GILID stock price due to expected cure rates )
3. Positive ( new therapy approvals for cKD and GT-1 )
4. Small positive increase

Combining these, the overall sentiment seems neutral because one tweet has a slight negative impact while the others are positive and balanced out.

So, putting it all together, the overall sentiment is neutral."
2015-04-09,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price.

First, I need to extract the stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""mrk spent too much money ( > $6b ) bringing this combo to market to discount it too much ."" Hmm, that doesn't directly mention a stock. Maybe it's referring to a specific company or an acronym? Wait, 'mrk' could stand for something else, but I'm not sure. Since the output only includes one line per run, maybe each tweet should have its own conclusion.

But looking again, all the tweets provided are just three lines without mentioning a stock symbol. That's confusing. Perhaps these tweets are about a specific company that I missed? Or maybe they're all about different aspects of the same company?

Wait, let me read them again:

1. AT_USER AT_USER - $ mrk spent too much money ( > $6b ) bringing this combo to market to discount it too much .
2. The tweet is about another company.
3. ""Mrk"" is used again in a different context.

So maybe these are all tweets from the same source, and 'mrk' stands for a particular stock. Since the user hasn't provided the stock symbols yet, I need to figure that out or assume a value. Let's go with 'Mrk' as the stock symbol for now.

Now, processing each tweet:

1. The first tweet talks about $mrk spending too much money and discounting it. It seems like they're discussing a company going through an IPO or some investment activity. But it's not clear if this is positive or negative. The mention of spending more than $6b doesn't necessarily mean good or bad, just that the company has allocated funds.

2. The second tweet is about ""The tweet is about another company."" Without knowing the stock symbol, I can't assess sentiment directly. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps referring to a different 'mrk'?

3. The third tweet also uses ""Mrk"" again but in a different context: ""Mrk"" and a discount on ""MRK"". Again, without knowing if this is positive or negative, I can't assess.

Wait, this is confusing because each tweet doesn't specify the stock symbol. Maybe these are not individual tweets for a specific stock but just general comments about 'mrk'. That would make it impossible to determine sentiment since there's no context about whether it's good or bad for the company.

But looking back at the user's question, they provided three tweets and asked me to conclude the impact on a company's stock price. So perhaps in reality, these are all from one tweet with multiple lines? Or maybe each line is separate?

Wait, I think the initial analysis was correct: each tweet is for a specific stock. But since 'mrk' isn't present, it's unclear.

Given that confusion, maybe the user intended to provide the stock symbol in each tweet. Let me check again:

No, looking at the first tweet: ""mrk spent too much money ... discounting it too much ."" So that's for 'mrk'.

The second tweet doesn't mention a stock symbol but continues on about another company.

Third tweet is also unclear.

This seems inconsistent. Perhaps all three tweets are from one source talking about different stocks? Or maybe the user made a mistake.

Assuming each line is separate, and each has its own stock symbol:

1. First tweet: ""mrk spent too much money ( > $6b ) bringing this combo to market to discount it too much ."" For 'MRK' perhaps.

2. Second tweet: No stock symbol—maybe it's about a different company.

3. Third tweet: Again, unclear without a stock symbol.

This inconsistency makes it difficult to determine sentiment because I don't have the context for each individual tweet regarding their respective stocks.

Wait, maybe in reality, the tweets are all from one source discussing 'Mrk' or 'MRK', but the user didn't include the stock symbols. Without that information, I can't evaluate each tweet's impact on a specific company's stock price.

Perhaps the user intended to provide the stock symbols and then I should analyze them? Or maybe they just provided incomplete tweets without the stock symbol.

In any case, since I have only one output line required, I'll proceed with analyzing based on the first tweet as an example. If all are for different stocks, it's impossible to assess sentiment.

But given that, let's say 'MRK' is the stock and proceed.

So the conclusion would be ""Neutral"" because the tweet doesn't provide any positive or negative indicators about the stock."
2015-04-10,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the given tweet affects the stock price of a company. The tweet is $ mrk - why investors shouldn't worry about explosive new drug pricing : maxim's jason kolbert url.

First, I need to extract the stock symbol from the tweet. The word ""mrk"" in dollars probably stands for Maxim's Corporation. So the stock is Maximization Inc.

Now, looking at the factors mentioned: ""why investors shouldn't worry about explosive new drug pricing"". That sounds like a positive statement because it suggests that the company isn't planning for something concerning drugs. I remember that if a company plans to launch or develop something significant without any issues, especially in areas they might be involved with, it can boost their stock price.

The tweet also mentions Maxim's Jason Kolbert's URL. Maybe he's an executive or a figure associated with the company. The phrase ""exploring new markets"" could imply that Maximization is venturing into uncharted territories, which might help in diversifying their operations and increasing revenue streams.

Other factors mentioned aren't directly impacting stock price negatively here, but positive ones are clear. So overall, I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment because Maxim's actions here are seen as strategic and beneficial for the company."
2015-04-11,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about penny stocks and determine their impact on the stock price. So, I'm given two tweets here: ""Our penny stock alerts on $thcz gained over 800%! Subscribe to get our next pick : URL stocks $mrk $lnd""

First off, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweet. The words mentioned are ""penny stock"" and the symbols $thcz, $mrk, $lnd. Since they all have dollar signs followed by letters and sometimes numbers in parentheses, it's likely that these are stock ticker symbols like TSMC or LND. Looking at the context, the user mentions ""url stocks,"" which might be referring to an online stock trading platform, so I think the target stock is LND.

Next, each tweet has positive and negative factors. Let me break down each sentence:

1. ""Our penny stock alerts on $thcz gained over 800%!"" – This seems to indicate a strong positive news about the stock performance.
2. ""Subscribe to get our next pick : URL stocks $mrk $lnd"" – The word ""URL"" is used, and $lnd might be the stock ticker for LND. So this probably relates to LND.

Now, assessing the sentiment from each tweet: The first one clearly states that the stock has grown by over 800%, which is a strong positive sign. The second tweet's use of ""Subscribe"" implies it could be about LND, so another positive point.

Combining these, both tweets are positive. The user is recommending and predicting a significant increase in LND's value. So the overall sentiment should be Positive."
2015-04-12,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, there are two tweets about Pfeifer (PFE) because the first one mentions MRK and PFE, but then it says ""full chart : URL cml."" The second tweet is about 1 site for investors! with several other stocks: $mrk, $mcp, $rad, $adx$.

From step 1, I identify the target stock as PFE. Now, analyzing each relevant tweet:

The first tweet says, ""largest pharmaceuticals , biotechnology and life sciences revenue 1 . $ jnj 2 . $ pfe 3 . $ mrk full chart : URL cml"" – this seems like PFE's financial news. The mention of revenue could be positive or negative depending on the amount.

The second tweet is more marketing-oriented: ""1 site for investors ! $mrk, $mcp, $rad, $adx$."" This looks promotional and could increase investor confidence but might not directly affect a company's stock price unless it indicates support for other stocks like MRK or others mentioned.

Putting this together, the main positive factor is PFE's revenue, which is a strong indicator of future performance. The second tweet is just extra info without specific impact on the stock itself. So overall sentiment should be Positive."
2015-04-13,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company like Merck, Inc. First, I need to understand each tweet individually.

The first tweet says ""$ mrk : update : short interest of merck & company , inc . increases by 12.2 % : URL"". So this seems to be providing information about short interest. Short interest is the number of shares sold short, which can indicate investor sentiment. If short interest goes up, it might mean more people are selling their stocks short, which could lead to a bullish outlook for the company because it's less likely they'll go bankrupt or face significant negative news.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER ebola phase iii studies underpopulated as epidemic wanes : URL $ mrk $ nlnk $ tkmr"". This looks like an engagement post related to an event. It mentions that there were phase III studies on Ebola, and the user is saying that these studies haven't been underpopulated yet because the epidemic is still ongoing. If people are more engaged with such news, it could create buzz around Merck, potentially affecting their stock price. The mention of a positive note about the epidemic might be seen as encouraging for investors who expect good results.

Now, combining both tweets, the first one indicates a positive news factor (increase in short interest), and the second is an engagement tweet that could positively influence investor sentiment by creating buzz. Both factors suggest optimism about Merck's future, which would likely lead to a positive overall sentiment. Therefore, I should conclude with ""[Positive]"" as the overall impact."
2015-04-14,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user provided two tweets and asked me to determine if they are Positive, Neutral, or Negative regarding their likely effect on the stock.

First, let's break down each tweet individually. 

The first tweet says: ""heat biologics is an opportunity among soaring immunotherapy …"" It mentions heat biologics being involved in immunotherapy. Immunotherapy can be a therapeutic area, maybe leading to increased sales or revenue for the company. However, without knowing the specific industry and market conditions, it's hard to gauge the exact impact. But I think it might be a positive sign because it highlights a potential growth area. 

The second tweet is about: ""url analyze : url"" but there's no content after that except maybe a placeholder like URL analyze or URL. Wait, looking again, it says ""url analyze"" but the rest is just URL. So this one doesn't seem to be adding any meaningful information. It looks like some text is missing here, which makes me think it might not contribute much to the analysis.

So for the first tweet, since it's about heat biologics and immunotherapy, I'm leaning towards a positive outlook because immunotherapy can drive sales, especially if they're targeting a specific market or expanding into new areas. 

The second tweet is confusingly written but doesn't provide any useful information. It might be a typo or incomplete, so there's no data to assess its impact on the stock price.

Putting it all together: The first tweet points towards a positive sentiment, while the second doesn't add much. So the overall sentiment would be Positive because one of the tweets gives a hopeful outlook."
2015-04-15,Negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets are affecting the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet separately.

The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER ebola vaccine candidate phase iii study begins in sierra leone - URL $ mrk $ nlnk URL"". Hmm, this seems like an interesting piece of information. The user is talking about the ongoing phase III study for an ebola vaccine being started in Sierra Leone. I remember that ebola vaccines are often discussed in relation to global health issues and potential stock performance due to their impact on the economy or public health sectors.

I know that government investments can affect stock prices, especially if they're allocated towards healthcare or defense. If there's a phase III study on a vaccine related to an outbreak like ebola, it might be seen as a positive indicator of technological advancement and global cooperation. Investors often look at government spending and their potential impact on the economy.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER $ clvs $ kpti $ mrk URL"". This one looks more straightforward with some keywords. The user mentions ""clvs"", which I believe stands for closing values or stock price movements, but it's followed by ""$ kr"" which might indicate a lowercase 'k' like a currency symbol, possibly Indian rupees. So, this tweet is likely signaling that the company's stock price is going down from previous levels.

Now, putting it together: The first tweet suggests more investment and government action, which could be positive for the stock. The second tweet indicates a downward trend in the stock price. However, without knowing the context of these tweets relative to each other or the overall market, it's hard to weigh them equally.

But generally, when a company shows a clear downward movement due to negative news like stock prices dropping, especially if there are upcoming studies or projects, it can cause concerns about future performance. So while one tweet is positive, the second seems more direct and impactful in causing a negative effect on the stock price.

So, considering both factors—positive from the study but negative from the stock movement—the overall sentiment is leaning towards [Negative]. Because even though there's some optimistic information, the immediate decrease in the stock suggests that investors are feeling down, which can negatively impact their decisions."
2015-04-16,Neutral,"Alright, let me break down how I approached analyzing these tweets about MTRK.

First, I identified the target stock symbol from each tweet. The main one seems to be MTRK (MRK). Then, for each tweet, I separated them into Positive and Negative factors based on their content.

Looking at the first tweet, suntrust's comments on Merck with a price target of $72 were positive because they were encouraging investment. But then there was a link from AT_USER to Mrk, which made me wonder about their relationship or context, not directly affecting MTRK. So that was neutral overall.

The second tweet mentioned Kenneth Fraizer joining the top-paid pharma CEOs in 2014 and highlighted his role as a strong leader. This is positive because it reinforces a positive sentiment towards the company's management team.

In the third tweet, it asked Mrk's CEO Ken Fraizer about America's top two drug companies' CEs. It seems like it was seeking input but didn't mention any specific action or impact on MTRK. Therefore, that part wasn't directly influencing MTRK's stock price.

When I combined all factors, the positive tweet from suntrust had a small positive impact, while Mrk's CEO is mentioned positively by Fraizer. However, without concrete actions affecting MTRK, the overall sentiment was neutral."
2015-04-17,Positive,"Alright, so I've got to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. Let me start by breaking down what each tweet says.

The first tweet mentions a penny stock pick gaining 1600% over four months and encourages subscriptions. It's using hashtags like $ insy $ mrk, which probably refers to Twitter's screen names. The positive part here is the big gain, but I also notice they're subscribing via URL, maybe to get more updates or something. Those are common ways people stay informed, so that seems positive.

The second tweet talks about stock options and an update from option millionaires. It says it's Friday morning reads with a chatroom, which sounds like they're offering information or insights related to the stock. The mention of ""stock options chatroom"" might indicate that there are discussions around trading or investing, but without more context, I'm not sure if it's positive or negative.

Looking at each tweet separately: The first seems positive about potential gains and subscriptions. The second is a bit unclear in sentiment—it could be offering information (neutral) or perhaps even encouraging engagement (positive). But since both tweets are positive in their own way, maybe the overall impact isn't overwhelming.

I think it's mostly positive because there's a clear call to subscribe for updates, which is always good. The other tweet might just be pushing for more discussions but not necessarily reinforcing trends. So combining these, I'd say overall it's positive."

2015-04-19,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user has provided a query where they've given me some tweets and asked me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the tweet: ""big pharma daily & weekly charts ... $ mrk looking weak URL"". Hmm, it starts with ""mrk"", which I know stands for MRK. I believe that MRK is a stock symbol related to Big Pharma or a big pharmaceutical company. The word ""looking weak"" gives me a clue about the trend of their stock price.

Now, let's analyze this step by step. 

1. **Identify the Target Stock**: The first thing I do when given a tweet like this is to extract the stock symbol. Here, it's ""mrk"", so that's our target company.

2. **Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis**:
   - (a) **Separate Factors**: Each tweet has factors. In this case, there are two parts: ""big pharma daily & weekly charts"" and ""$ mrk looking weak URL"". The first part is about the stock performance over time, which usually indicates a trend in price movement. The second part mentions $mrk, which likely refers to the stock's current price or value.
   - (b) **Assess Sentiment**: The tweet starts with ""looking weak"", which might suggest that the company's stock is not performing as expected. The word ""URL"" doesn't directly relate here, but perhaps it's just a placeholder in the tweet for more details.

3. **Overall Sentiment Summary**: Combining these thoughts, the mention of ""weak URL"" suggests that investors are likely expecting the stock price to drop or decline. The daily and weekly charts further support this because they show the stock's performance over periods, which can indicate whether it's going up or down.

So putting it all together, since the tweet is talking about the stock performing poorly (weaker) in both daily and weekly, along with a specific mention of $mrk, it leans towards negative sentiment. Investors are probably cautious and seeing this information, leading them to doubt their expectations."
2015-04-20,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Merck. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see how they might affect the stock.

First tweet: $ mrk . earlier than expected lung cancer filing limited to pdl 1 high patients URL. Hmm, this seems positive because it's updating their patient numbers for lung cancer, which is a good sign about their treatment progress. That should probably boost their stock.

Second tweet: rt AT_USER merck cancer drug shines against skin , lung cancer URL $ mrk $ bmy aacr 15. This looks like they're talking about a drug that helps with skin-related cancers. That's another positive point because it shows improved treatment options, which can improve patient satisfaction and increase demand for their stock.

Third tweet: merck ’ s hepatitis c therapy regains fda ' breakthrough ' status URL AT_USER $ mrk. Merck's hepatitis C treatment now qualifies as a breakthrough under the FDA. That’s significant because breakthrough drugs often have better success rates or more approvals, which can positively impact their stock performance.

Fourth tweet: rt AT_USER the keytruda lung cancer study was profiled on the nbc nightly news this evening . word is getting out . $ mrk aacr 15 URL. This mentions the keytruda Lung Cancer Study being covered by a news agency. I'm not entirely sure what keytruda stands for, but it sounds like they're another drug related to lung cancer. If their study shows improved survival odds, that would be positive.

Fifth tweet: most active healthcare stocks : abbvie inc . ( nyse : abbv ) , merck & co . inc ... $ mrk URL. The word ""most"" suggests that other stocks are also performing well, but since it's not a direct mention of Merck, I'm not sure about the impact. Maybe it means they're doing well in general healthcare stocks, which might not directly affect Merck.

Sixth tweet: $ mrk : keytruda shows improved survival odds in melanoma - wsj. Again, similar to the fourth tweet, mentioning another drug. If keytruda has better survival rates for melanoma, that's good news for their stock.

Now, putting it all together. All six tweets seem to be positive, especially pointing towards Merck receiving breakthrough treatments and having more successful drug studies. This could indicate increased demand, better market presence, or improved patient outcomes. So overall, the sentiment is positive."
2015-04-21,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user has provided two tweets and asked for my analysis on their likely impact on a company's stock price. They want me to choose between [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, the second one mentions ""mrk"", which is a common ticker symbol for Merck, so that must be the stock in question.

Next, each tweet needs to be analyzed. The first tweet starts with ""rt AT_USER important for mrk azn rhhby fda will not require os..."" This seems like a promotional link or announcement about something related to Merck. I'm not immediately sure what it's promoting, but the mention of Merck and mentions of functions (like os) could indicate that this tweet is about updating their product or something relevant to their operations.

The second tweet says ""$ mrk : keytruda by merck & co . , inc . ( nyse : mrk ) is more effective than ... : URL"". This looks like an official announcement from Merck, stating that they've introduced a new product or improved their services. Such statements usually convey approval or confirmation about a new product.

Now, for each tweet, I need to identify positive and negative factors. The first tweet might have both positive and negative factors if it's promoting something that could go either way, but the mention of Merck and ""fda will not require os"" suggests they're making a statement related to their product or regulatory approvals, which is generally positive for stock performance.

The second tweet is more direct. It says Merck is more effective than ... , which is a strong endorsement, leading to an increase in sentiment. This kind of statement usually leads to a positive outcome because it can boost investor confidence and corporate reputation.

Combining both tweets, the first one might have a slight negative angle if there are concerns about fda approvals or regulatory issues, but the second tweet clearly reinforces Merck's effectiveness. Over time, consistent strong statements like these tend to lead to a positive stock performance as investors see merit in their products and companies."
2015-04-22,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. Let's break down each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from the first tweet. The tweet mentions something about ""mrk pharma"" with a price target of $50%. That seems like it's associated with Moderna (MRK) or maybe another pharmaceutical company. But since it's explicitly mentioning mrk pharma, I'll go with MRK.

Next, each tweet is separated into positive and negative factors. For the first tweet, both ""deep discounts"" and ""allow remicade biosimilar"" are mentioned as positive factors. The negative factor is ""grab 50% of Norway's market."" This could impact investor sentiment negatively because grabbing a significant portion might lead to negative news if it's seen as a competitive advantage.

I should assess the overall sentiment for each tweet. The first one has two positive factors and one negative, which balances out but leans towards neutral because the negatives are more impactful than positives in this context.

Since there's only one relevant tweet provided, I'll summarize that into the final output."

2015-04-25,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on stock price. So, I need to go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol here is ""insy.com"". The user has provided a couple of tweets about this stock. Let's see what each tweet says.

The first tweet is: ""we have an absolutely massive new stock pick out ! get early access : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"" Hmm, so it seems like they're releasing something significant and offering early access. The use of ""url breakout"" might be a typo or maybe referring to a product launch. The mention of a ""major new stock pick"" suggests they are introducing something that could potentially increase the company's revenue or earnings.

The second tweet is: ""we have an absolutely massive new stock pick out ! get early access : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"" Wait, that seems identical to the first one. Maybe it's a repetition? Both tweets mention the same thing—introducing a new stock with potential for early access and some kind of bonus or token offering.

Now, considering the target symbol is ""insy.com"", which stands out because I remember they're known in crypto circles as Insyco or something similar. Maybe this stock could be related to crypto, but it's not explicitly stated here.

Looking at each tweet, both are offering early access and mention a URL breakout, which might indicate a new product launch or token sale. Early access can sometimes increase investor interest, especially if they want to see the product before it goes public. It also opens up the possibility for more revenue streams or increased visibility into the company.

So, putting this together: Both tweets are promoting something significant with early access. This could boost investor sentiment positively as it shows potential growth and excitement about the stock's future. However, if these tweets are redundant or maybe just the same information being repeated, that might not add much new information beyond what's already been stated.

But since both tweets are provided, I should probably consider each one individually before combining them. The first tweet is saying they're offering early access with a URL, and so is the second. So together, it's like two separate promotional messages about the same product or service.

In terms of sentiment impact, these promotions can certainly be positive because they show interest in the stock, which can lead to more shares being bought, higher valuations, and possibly increased demand from institutional investors who see potential growth.

Additionally, early access can sometimes make investors confident that the stock will perform well. It's a common strategy in the tech or crypto space where companies might offer early access to beta shares to test their product before full launch. This could also help in building anticipation for future earnings and market shifts.

Considering all this, I would lean towards a positive sentiment because both tweets are reinforcing a promotion that can drive investor interest and potentially increase stock value."
2015-04-26,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Gilead. Let me start by breaking down what each tweet is saying.

First, the user is mentioning the P/E and P/S multiples for Gilead compared to biotech and pharma peers. That makes me think about financial metrics. The symbols they're using are gilead, which I believe is a company that might be in the pharmaceuticals or biotech sector because ""pharma"" and ""biotech"" are common abbreviations there.

Now, P/E stands for Price-to-Earnings ratio, right? So it's the price of the stock divided by its earnings per share. A higher P/E ratio can indicate overvaluation if peers are also high. But I'm not sure if that alone means positive or negative for Gilead yet.

Then there's P/S, which is Price-to-Sales ratio. This is similar but compares the stock price to revenue instead of earnings. Again, a higher P/S could mean more value per dollar of sales. However, I don't have any numbers here, so it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative.

I should also consider what other users are saying. The user says ""rt AT_USER gilead p / e and ev / sales multiples compared to biotech / pharma peers $ celg $ mrk $ gild $ ibb URL."" Wait, there seems to be some typos in the symbols: ""celc"" should probably be ""cleg"", ""mrk"" might be ""mrg"", and ""gild"" is a bit odd. Maybe they meant ""glycine""? Those are all abbreviations I recognize. Cleg would be Celsight, mrg is Mergentech, glycine is Glcigen, and ibb could mean Insect Biochemistry. So these are probably companies in the pharmaceutical industry.

Looking at each tweet: ""cleg"" is a financial ratio comparison to peers, same with mrg (Mergentech), gild (glycine) and ibb (Insect Biochemistry). If all these multiples are higher than others, it might mean that Gilead's performance is better relative to its peers, which could be positive.

But wait, I'm not sure if this information alone tells the whole story. I would need more context about Gilead's actual financial performance and market position in their sector. Maybe looking at other tweets or industry trends could help assess whether there's any news that might affect them.

Overall, without additional data, it's challenging to say for sure if this tweet is positive, negative, or neutral. It depends on how the company is performing relative to others, but with the given info, I think it's a bit safer to consider the information as mixed and not definitive."
2015-04-27,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock prices. So, the user provided two tweets and wants me to determine if each is positive, negative, or neutral in terms of affecting a company's stock price.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""what to expect when merck $ mrk reports earnings tuesday morning URL"". Hmm, this seems like an update on Merck's earnings. If they report good earnings, that usually benefits investors because it can attract more capital and improve future financials. But if it's a disappointing earnings report, it might lead to negative sentiment.

But wait, the user also mentioned extracting the stock symbol. The tweet mentions $ mrk, which I know is Merck. So, the stock in question is Merck.

Now, considering that earnings reports are generally expected to provide some indication about future performance. If Merck expects positive earnings, it might signal confidence among investors, leading to a rise in stock price. Conversely, if they're expecting negative news, it could cause concern and decrease stock value.

However, the tweet is quite short with just ""what to expect when merck... tuesday morning URL."" It's more of a prompt rather than a full statement or analysis. Since there's no actual information given beyond the expectation of earnings on a specific day, it's hard to gauge the impact. The sentiment isn't clear yet because we don't have enough details.

But in the context of the task, I'm supposed to infer based on the tweets and my analysis. If the tweet is about an upcoming earnings report, even if incomplete, it might still carry some weight. Without specifics like actual earnings numbers or broader market reactions, it's challenging to be certain whether it's positive or negative.

Considering that some users of this platform sometimes include detailed information in their tweets to give context, perhaps this tweet is leading the analysis without providing complete data. So, I'll lean towards a [Neutral] sentiment because there isn't enough information, but it could have an impact if earnings turn out as expected.

Wait, no, actually, if someone is preparing an analysis and sees this tweet, they might infer that the stock is performing well based on upcoming reports. But since this tweet itself isn't stating anything definitive beyond the expectation, it's a bit of both. Maybe I'll go with [Neutral] because it introduces a new piece of information but without sufficient details to be certain.

But let me think again. The task says to conclude with one tag. Since it's about an earnings report, and even though incomplete, it might influence investor sentiment positively by signaling confidence or growth expectations. So perhaps the overall sentiment should be [Positive]. But I'm not entirely sure because without more context, it's a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, if there were no positive factors mentioned beyond this tweet, maybe it doesn't affect much, so [Neutral] would make sense as there might be no significant push for up or down. But honestly, given that there's an expectation, it could be considered positive in the short term even if long-term expectations are uncertain.

I think I'm leaning towards [Positive] because the anticipation of earnings is positive news, and stock prices often go up when they're expected to grow."
2015-04-28,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of $mrk. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet talks about idix nuke and mentions using sofosbuvir instead. That seems negative because it's about criticism or disappointment in a stock.
2. The second tweet discusses keytruda being used for immunotherapy, which might have some medical implications but not directly related to the company's stock performance.
3. The third tweet is about a Bristol-myers cancer treatment disappointing and shares its earnings via AT_USER. This could affect investor sentiment positively if they expect positive news, but I'm unsure without more context.
4. The fourth tweet mentions januvia meeting their goal in a cardiovascular trial. While it's a positive outcome for the company, it might not directly impact $mrk unless there are related developments.
5. The fifth tweet provides financial estimates. Positive because earnings expectations could suggest future performance, but I'm unsure if this is a direct signal.
6. This one asks about how big keytruda can be in lung cancer. It seems like a strategic statement without immediate financial implications for $mrk.
7. This tweet states that Aetos's stocks turn slightly higher, which is positive news and could influence investor sentiment positively.
8. The eighth tweet talks about earnings for biotech and pharma companies across multiple sectors. It's more about the company's performance in various areas rather than a direct impact on $mrk.
9. The last tweet discusses cubist developing their growth platform for acute care, which is a strategic move that could have broader implications but might not be directly related to $mrk unless it affects their market position.

Putting this together, the most significant positive tweet is number 7 and number 9. Positive trends are increasing investor confidence in Aetos's stock and potential expansion into acute care. However, some tweets are more strategic or speculative without clear financial benefits. Considering all these factors, I think $mrk might have a slight positive impact on its stock."
2015-04-29,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user has provided two tweets and asked me to analyze them. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, both include ""apl"" which is Apple Inc., so I'm assuming we're talking about Apple. That makes sense because other words like $twtr might refer to Target or something else, but in this case, it seems related to Apple.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate the factors and assess their impact on sentiment. The user provided two tweets:

1. ""rt AT_USER active options @ cboe : $ aapl $ tsla $ ypf $ amzn $ x $ pbr $ mrk $ jblu $ abx""

2. ""rt @bloomberg : @bcom: $ aapl$ tspv $ x $ pbr$ mrk $ jblu $ x""

Alright, I need to extract the relevant factors from each tweet. The user mentioned that for each tweet, I should identify Positive and Negative factors.

Starting with the first tweet:
- ""rt AT_USER active options @ cboe : $ aapl $ tsla $ ypf $ amzn $ x $ pbr $ mrk $ jblu $ abx""

I see multiple stock symbols here: aapl (Apple), tsla (Technologies), ypf (Tech also?), amzn (Amazon), and several others. The hashtags are @ cboe, which is from the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, and a bunch of other indicators.

Looking at each symbol:
- aapl: Positive
- tsla: Positive
- ypf: I'm not sure if this is positive or negative. It seems related to something tech-related.
- amzn: Also positive
- Other symbols like x (which could be Xero, but maybe it's unrelated here) and pbr (probably Peter Bauman & Company, which isn't relevant to Apple)

The hashtags mention @ cboe, which might relate to stock trading or exchange.

Now for the second tweet:
""rt @bloomberg : @bcom: $ aapl$ tspv $ x $ pbr$ mrk $ jblu $ x""

Again, aapl is positive. tspv isn't clear – it could be Trump Speech or something else. x again, and pbr, mrk, jblu are all unrelated to Apple.

So now I need to assess each factor's sentiment impact on the stock price. From my previous knowledge, most factors related to tech companies like X, Tesla, Amazon, etc., tend to have mixed sentiments because they can be both positive (like Xero) and negative (like Trump Speech). However, other factors might lean towards positive.

Let me go through each tweet's factors:

First tweet:
- aapl: Positive
- tsla: Positive
- ypf: Not sure, but maybe not too impactful
- amzn: Positive

Negative factors mentioned: none. So overall sentiment is positive based on these positive factors and possibly neutral on others.

Second tweet:
- aapl: Positive
- tspv: Maybe negative (Trump Speech)
- x: Not sure
- pbr: Probably negative
- mrk: Not relevant
- jblu: Not related

So here, some factors are positive and others might be negative. This could make the sentiment uncertain or mixed.

Now combining both tweets:
Positive from aapl in both, but then negative factors like tspv and pbr could pull down the stock. The other symbols, if their factors aren't too significant, might not change much. So overall, there's some uncertainty because of these mixed signals.

But looking at each tweet separately, maybe the first one is more positive with clear positives and no negatives, which would suggest a stronger positive impact than the second tweet, which has mixed signals. However, since both tweets could be part of the same data feed or separate tweets, it's hard to combine them.

Wait, the user said "" tweets"" but didn't specify how many. If each tweet is independent, I might need to consider all relevant factors from both. But maybe in this case, only one tweet is provided. Let me check again.

No, looking back, the user provided two separate tweets. So I have two tweets. For each, their factors and sentiment can be considered individually, then overall combined.

But wait, actually, the first tweet might include multiple positive factors, while the second has some positives and some negatives. But without knowing which one is more impactful in the market, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps these are two separate pieces of information about Apple's stock. If each piece can affect its price independently, then each could have a slight impact. However, given that both factors (aapl and pbr) are positive but the second tweet also mentions tspv which might be negative, it's a mix.

But in terms of overall sentiment, maybe it's more positive because all the known positive factors outweigh the mixed negatives. Alternatively, if many other neutral or negative factors exist, the impact could be less positive.

However, without knowing the broader context and the exact stock price movements from these tweets, I can only assess based on what's in each tweet. Since the first tweet has more positive factors, maybe it gives a stronger boost to Apple's stock. The second tweet brings some positives but also some negatives that might cause concern.

But again, since both are separate tweets, and if they don't specify, perhaps each could influence the price independently. However, considering that both tweets mention ""apl"", which is a major player in tech, any positive factors will have more significant impacts on Apple's stock.

So overall sentiment-wise, maybe it's still positive but with mixed signals, making the impact uncertain. But the first tweet has clear positives, so perhaps the overall sentiment leans towards positive, even if some uncertainty exists from the second tweet.

Alternatively, since both tweets are about Apple, and the more significant factors (like aapl) are positive, despite other factors, the stock is likely to go up.

Wait, but in reality, if two separate tweets with mixed signals come into the market, how does that affect the price? Each could have some impact, but it's hard to tell without knowing the exact context. So maybe overall sentiment remains neutral or slightly positive, leaning towards a slight improvement.

But given that each tweet has at least one positive factor, and there are multiple factors in total, perhaps the stock is more likely to be slightly up. However, if some negative factors like tspv are present, it might pull down the price. So without knowing which tweets were seen together or separately, it's hard.

But since both are about Apple, any positive factors from either tweet could have a significant impact. The second tweet has a pbr which is a financial wealth management company, unrelated to tech companies like Apple. Maybe their stock movements don't directly affect Apple's. Similarly, mrk is another company entirely.

So focusing on the tweets that mention Apple: both are positive, but the second also mentions Xero (tspv) and Trump Speech (tspv), which might be negative or neutral. However, if Xero is a minor component of Apple's IT services division, it could still have some impact on revenue.

In summary, the first tweet has more clear positives, so perhaps that boosts the stock more than the second does. The second introduces a negative factor (tspv) which might pull down the price, but since it only mentions one negative factor, maybe the overall sentiment is positive but with some uncertainty due to mixed signals.

However, considering each tweet separately and their respective factors, the first tweet's clear positives suggest an upward trend. So I think the overall impact is likely a slight positive, leading me to classify it as [Positive]."
2015-04-30,Missing,File not found
2015-05-01,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the target stock symbol mentioned in the tweets. The user has provided a tweet with ""insy $ mrk"" which might refer to specific stocks, but since they aren't provided, I'll assume it's referring to Insy and MRK. However, without knowing the exact company or stock, it's hard to assess the impact directly.

Looking at each relevant tweet:

1. The first tweet says, ""our penny stock picks gained 1472 % in 2 months ! get access to our new picks early : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk."" This seems positive because it mentions a significant gain and an offer for further insights or information about InsY and MRK.

2. Wait, but I don't have the exact target stock symbol. If ""insy $ mrk"" are separate stocks, perhaps they're referring to specific individual stocks within the company. But without knowing which stock we're looking at, I can't evaluate the performance of that particular stock based on these tweets alone.

But considering the user's output example and the context provided earlier, in the tweet about InsY, the sentiment was positive because it highlighted a significant gain and offered further information. Similarly, for MRK, it also showed potential gains but didn't offer information, leading to a neutral sentiment since investors would be concerned about missing out.

However, without knowing which stock we're analyzing, I can only assume that any mention of gains suggests a positive impact on the stock's value. But in reality, each tweet could influence different stocks differently based on their fundamentals and market conditions.

So, considering the tweets provided:
- Positive tweets indicate potential gains for investors.
- Neutral tweets might refer to information without immediate implications beyond what is mentioned.
- Negative tweets would suggest possible declines or concerns that would require investors to reconsider their positions.

But since I don't have specific stock symbols or more context, I can only make a general assessment. If the tweet mentions a significant increase in stock value and offers additional details, it's positive. If it's vague or just informational without impact, it could be neutral or even negative if there are concerns about missing out on critical information.

In this case, since the first tweet is more concrete with a 1472% gain, I would lean towards a Positive sentiment overall."
2015-05-02,Positive,"Alright, let's break down how I approached analyzing the tweet about $mrk and its predicted 50% growth. First, I identified the stock symbol as mrk. Then, I looked at the factors: Positive mentions were the $mrk increase by 50%, positive website links like ""الوبشن توصيات"" suggesting trust or popularity, and positive sentiment towards the future. 

I noticed the tweet emphasized potential growth and user recommendations, which are all positive indicators for investor confidence. Combining these elements made me think they would boost stock prices, so I concluded it was a positive impact."
2015-05-03,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets about the stock market and determine whether they're positive, neutral, or negative for the given company.

First, looking at tweet number 1: ""rt AT_USER merck & co . ' s buy rating reiterated at bank of america . $ 65.00 pt . URL $ mrk mrk"". This looks like a news report where a user is updating their stock rating. I know that when companies update their ratings, it's usually positive because it reflects confidence in the company's performance. The term ""merck & co"" refers to Merck, and updating the rating at Bank of America suggests they're confident enough to change their outlook. So this seems like a positive signal for investors.

Next, tweet number 2: ""sdt sandridge mississippian trust i current price click here -> URL trending $ sdt $ ibb $ mrk $ agen sdt stockmarket …"". This tweet is about the stock of SDT Sandridge. The user mentions that it's a trending stock and asks if they can click here to see more info, which suggests that there might be some interest or speculation in the stock price. However, without specific details on whether the stock is going up or down, this seems like just a general mention. It could influence investor sentiment but doesn't present a clear positive or negative outlook.

Lastly, tweet number 3: "" $ csl $ sne $ mrk $ ori the week ahead webinar : may 5th , 2015 - update from option millionaires - stock options chatr ... URL"". This tweet is announcing a webinar on May 5th about options and stock market. Option webinars can sometimes provide insights or updates that might affect stock prices, but without knowing the specific topic of the webinar, it's hard to tell if this will be positive or negative. It could either increase investor interest in the stock or decrease it, depending on what the experts discuss.

Summarizing each tweet: The first is clearly positive with an update, the second has some speculation, and the third is speculative but possibly not conclusive. Combining these factors, there seems to be a mix of signals that might lead investors towards a positive outlook, but some uncertainty makes it neutral."
2015-05-04,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative regarding a company's future stock price. Let me break it down.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the tweets: ""mrk"". Hmm, that's ""Microsoft"" in lowercase letters. So, the focus is on Microsoft.

Next, I'll analyze each tweet separately. Both tweets are identical and mention "" japan's peptidream , $ mrk in targeted peptide deal URL"". The word ""peptidream"" seems like a typo or slang for something specific, maybe related to biotechnology or drug development.

Now, focusing on the second part: ""$ mrk in targeted peptide deal URL"". If I assume that ""mrk"" stands for Microsoft, this implies that Japanese companies are making peptides for the target market. Targeted peptides could be a move by Japanese companies to produce something for their international customers, which might involve advertising or marketing efforts.

But wait, this seems a bit off because producing peptides for targeted markets is more common in Japan rather than from outside companies like Microsoft. That makes me think that this isn't a positive development for Microsoft's stock because it doesn't show anything about the company's business strategy or growth prospects. Instead, it's likely unrelated.

So each tweet is just repeating information that doesn't provide any insight into Microsoft's future stock price. They're all negative in nature since they don't suggest any improvement or positive action for investors.

Putting this together, both tweets lack any meaningful content that would influence investor sentiment positively about Microsoft's stock. They might be marketing efforts or unrelated news that doesn't impact the stock price."
2015-05-05,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact on the stock price of a company based on the given tweets. The user has provided four tweets and wants me to analyze them to give a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment towards the stock.

First, let me identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through the tweets, I see mentions like ""gild"", ""mrk"", ""azn"", and ""biib"". It seems these are all technology-related stocks. The user also provided links to different companies, so I need to figure out which one is the main focus here.

Looking closer at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER $ gild $ mrk after markman ruling , case will proceed to expert discovery and summary judgment , hearing on latter schedul …"". It mentions a ruling related to MRK (maybe Selsig Corporation) regarding construction cases in California. So, the main stock here is Gild.

Tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER $ gild $ mrk negative claim construction ruling for $ gild in california case where $ mrk is alleging infringement by solv …"". This also mentions MRK and California, so again, probably Gild.

Tweets 3 and 4 mention BAIIB (Biib), AZN (Azadecam), and LLY (Alzincain). These are different stocks. However, since the user didn't specify the target stock symbol, I might have to consider if there's a common thread or if multiple stocks are involved. But given that the tweets mention Gild in the first two, perhaps the focus is on that company.

Now, evaluating each tweet for positive or negative factors:

1. Tweet 1: ""markman ruling , case will proceed"". This suggests that the matter under consideration (construction cases) is moving forward. Positive because it's progress. Factor 1: Positive
2. Tweet 2: ""negative claim"". A negative claim implies that there was a negative outcome in a case, which could be bad news. Factor 2: Negative

Combining these factors, we have one positive and one negative factor. The sentiment isn't overwhelmingly positive or negative; it's mixed.

3. Tweet 3 doesn't specify the stock but mentions issues with BAIIB, AZN, LLY. Since I don't know which of these corresponds to Gild, I can't assess their impact. But since the target is likely Gild, and without specific information on the tweets about GILD, I might have to make an assumption here.

4. Tweet 4 talks about market participants aware versus not; it's a bit vague but mentions market dynamics with $gild in California. Again, not directly related to GILD.

Considering tweet 1 as positive and tweet 2 as negative, without clear overall trend, I'm leaning towards mixed sentiment.

But wait, maybe the tweets are more about a broader trend or specific developments in the construction industry. If the case is moving forward but has a negative outcome, it could create some uncertainty. However, since the user didn't specify the stock symbol beyond GILD, which might be Selsig Corporation, I need to consider if the context of these tweets relates to their performance.

Selsig's recent ruling or case developments could potentially affect their stock price. If they've taken positive steps but now face a negative outcome in another matter, it might cause some volatility. However, without knowing GILD's current position, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if the tweets are about BAIIB, AZN, LLY, which are separate stocks, perhaps they're being compared or analyzed against GILD, but I don't have enough context for that.

Given all this uncertainty, and assuming the main focus is on GILD based on the first two tweets, maybe it's a mixed sentiment with some positive factors leading to mixed overall impact."
2015-05-06,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for IBM or related companies.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""$ ibm news : "" don't fall into this dividend investing trap $ ibm $ ip $ lmt $ mrk $ son "" URL analyze : URL. The relevant factors here are not falling into a dividend investing trap. I'm noticing some symbols like IP and LMT mentioned, which might be related to other companies or sectors. But the main point is about avoiding that common mistake in investing.

The sentiment seems positive because it's advising cautionary advice, which can help investors avoid negative risks, thereby improving their decisions. So this tweet is likely positive towards reducing potential losses from such investments.

Moving on to the second tweet: "" mrk merck & co . , inc . yield click here -> URL trending $ mrk $ cat $ xle $ twtr mrk invest nasdaq"". Here, the main points are that Merck Inc. (MRK) is trending up and investing in the Nasdaq. The word ""yield"" might indicate some positive movement or a good opportunity.

But I should check if it's a typo or just general sentiment. Since it mentions ""investing in the Nasdaq,"" this could mean either an upward trend or a strategic decision to expand into another market, which is generally positive for investors. So this tweet is also likely positive towards improving stock price.

Now, combining both tweets: The first is about avoiding a common mistake (positive), and the second is about increasing stock activity (also positive). Both points suggest confidence in the company's future performance or stability, reducing risks by advisable advice and strategic investments."
2015-05-07,Missing,File not found
2015-05-08,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of an unspecified company. I'll go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in the first tweet: ""mrk"". Wait, that doesn't look right because mrk is a company name, maybe a typo or placeholder. I should probably move past that for now and focus on other factors like individual tweets. Each tweet mentions different stocks, which makes it tricky to pinpoint exactly what the target stock is.

Looking at tweet 2: It's about AT_USER, which doesn't ring any bells. The mention of ""isoray"" isn't clear, but ""making sense of turning on and shutting down t-cells – all before dessert"". This seems like a medical or technical tweet, probably about a medical condition or treatment. Without context, it's hard to assess sentiment, especially since there are numbers involved like ""131 5/8"" which might be dates related to radiation therapy.

Tweet 3 is also about mrk again, but this time mentioning ""stifl"", ""bmy"", and others. It seems like a technical tweet discussing cell turnover. The mention of ""cervical cancer"" could be relevant, but without knowing what mrk does or the company's product, it's unclear.

Tweet 4 talks about ""isoray"" again, referring to mrk in relation to targeting tumors while avoiding other organs. This seems like a strategic tweet promoting mrk for treatment. The use of numbers and specific terms might imply some impact on patient outcomes but without more details, it's speculative.

I'm noticing that several tweets are discussing medical treatments or product mentions, which could affect stock prices based on potential benefits to patients. However, since the target stock isn't clear from the tweets, I can only make an educated guess based on the context provided. If these tweets discuss anything related to treatment outcomes or improvements in health conditions, it might indicate a positive impact.

But wait, some of these tweets mention radiotherapy details like dates and numbers, which could be more about safety measures rather than promoting treatments. For example, the number 131 5/8 might refer to radiation schedules. Without clear indication of treatment benefits or stock performance, I can't be certain. However, since multiple mentions are about treatments that could potentially improve patients' lives, it leans toward a positive overall sentiment."
2015-05-09,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""xoma xoma ltd . ex-div date click here -> URL trending $ xoma $ tlt $ biib $ mrk xoma stock trade ideas"". Hmm, this seems like an internal message or an announcement about the stock's status. The user is directing a reader to a website and mentioning something related to trends in XOM (Xoma), TLT (TLT), BIIB (Biib) and MRK (Mrk). I'm not sure what these abbreviations stand for, but if they are related to trading or stock performance, this could indicate support for the stock. It might be a bit vague, so it's hard to say for sure.

Second tweet: ""xoma xoma ltd . ex-div date click here -> URL trending $ xoma $ tlt $ biib $ mrk xoma stock trade ideas"". This looks similar to the first one but with an extra dot and perhaps some slight difference in wording. Again, it's likely a message about trends or trading info related to XOM. The structure seems consistent, so this could be reinforcing the previous tweet.

Third tweet: ""xoma xoma ltd . ex-div date click here -> URL trending $ xoma $ tlt $ biib $ mrk xoma stock trade ideas"". Again, repeating similar content, just slightly different in wording and maybe the number of dots. It's likely another announcement or trend indicator regarding XOM. The consistent use of phrases like ""stock trade ideas"" suggests potential trading-related advice.

Looking at all three tweets, they're all structured similarly but with slight variations. They seem to be promoting trends related to XOM stock. Without more context on what these stocks are (e.g., their industry, sector, historical performance) it's challenging to assess the sentiment directly. However, the use of ""ex-div date"" and ""trending"" terms might suggest that there is interest in trading or market analysis.

Since all three tweets are about trends and trading ideas around XOM, I don't have specific information on whether these actions are positive, negative, or neutral towards the stock. They could be positive if the user believes they're giving advice to increase trading activity or support the company. But without concrete evidence from the market or other sources, it's hard to make a definitive conclusion.

Considering all this, I think each tweet might not provide enough information for an informed sentiment assessment but is simply promoting potential trading discussions about XOM."
2015-05-10,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price. The tweet is ""$ xoma $ mrk"", which seems like it's mentioning XOM, probably a company. 

First, looking at Twitter handle ""xoma,"" maybe that's a typo for ""XOM""? That's a well-known stock symbol. So I think they're referring to XOM.

Now, the user provided an output requirement where the conclusion should be one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since this is a general analysis task without specific data, but given that it's about XOM which has been in the news often and generally considered a strong performer, I'd lean towards positive. However, sometimes companies have controversial issues or earnings reports that can affect stock prices.

Wait, looking back, there are no other tweets provided. So maybe this is just one tweet. Without more context, it's hard to be certain, but since it mentions XOM and given the commonality of positive news about tech stocks like XOM, I think it's likely positive."
2015-05-11,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a couple of tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on a company's stock price with either positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER roth the state of immunotherapy 3.0 : ' silver linings immunobook' ; bright horizons $ cldx $ lbio $ mrk $ bmy URL"". The word ""AT_USER"" might refer to Apple, given their stock symbol. So I think the target stock is Apple.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Let's look at the first tweet: It starts with ""rt AT_USER roth the state of immunotherapy 3.0 : ' silver linings immunobook'"". That seems like a news about immunotherapy, which could be related to health, maybe Apple's product. The rest are dollar symbols and URLs, but I'm not sure what those mean—maybe price changes or something else.

Wait, the first tweet ends with ""URL"", which is confusing. Maybe it's a typo or just an irrelevant part. Let me focus on the meaningful parts: ""the state of immunotherapy 3.0 : ' silver linings immunobook'"". That sounds like a statement about immunotherapy 3.0 and its benefits, perhaps related to Apple's health products.

The second tweet is ""$ mrk - statement of changes in beneficial ownership (4) URL"". This seems more relevant. It mentions beneficial ownership changes for the company, which could indicate how many shares are being added or removed—this affects investor sentiment because if there are changes in ownership, it can affect stock price movements.

So, for the first tweet: It's about immunotherapy 3.0 and health benefits, not sure about Apple's position yet. The second tweet is definitely about beneficial ownership, which could mean more shares bought or sold, affecting the stock.

Now, assessing sentiment: Both tweets mention ""beneficial ownership changes,"" so that's a strong indicator of investor interest in how the company is doing. More shares are being bought or sold, which can push the stock price up. Apple has been investing in health and wellness products, so perhaps there's positive momentum here.

Combining both tweets, they both point towards an increase in shares due to changes in beneficial ownership. So overall sentiment should be positive because of these indicators."
2015-05-12,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Merck & Co's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I should identify the target stock from each tweet. The main stock mentioned is ""url"" because some tweets mention $ mrk and others use ""url"". So the target stock seems to be URL stock.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. Merck & Co. sells $642,719 in $mrk at url.com.
   - This means they're selling shares of their stock. Selling shares can increase investor sentiment positively because it's a straightforward way for investors to buy or sell. However, I'm not sure if this is enough on its own.

2. $mrk received a new alert from the NYSE. They'll be trading stocks on nyse and nasdaq markets.
   - An alert from the NYSE could indicate increased investor interest or action. This might boost the stock price as they take more steps to trade, which can lead to positive sentiment.

3. DJIA descended by 0.2% with $intc and $mrk involved. They're down 18,068 units, stressed over losses from url.
   - The DJIA dropping along with some companies like INTC and MRK could indicate negative news affecting their performance on the NYSE. This might lead to a drop in stock price.

4. Our stock picks have had massive gains this year. They're seeing $mrk increase by $lnd.
   - Positive news about past performances can increase investor confidence, leading to an upward movement in the stock price.

5. Insider trading disclosures for may 12th involving several companies including url. $insy and $mrk mentioned.
   - Insider trading typically causes concern among investors because it can lead to manipulation or insider trading practices. This might result in a negative sentiment as concerns arise.

Now, summarizing the factors:

- Positive: massive gains from stock picks, selling shares ( tweet 4 is positive), and an alert (tweet 2).
- Negative: concerns about insider trading, increased stress over losses on DJIA (tweets 3 and 5).

I need to assess if these factors outweigh each other. The positive tweets like selling shares and the new alert can add significant momentum. However, the negative factors from the DJIA descent and insider trading might offset those positives.

The overall sentiment seems mixed but leans towards [Neutral]. This is because while there are both positive and negative indicators, they don't clearly suggest a clear trend in either direction."
2015-05-13,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on the given tweets. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I see the target stock is ""mrk,"" which stands for Merck & Co., Inc. From the tweets provided, the main point seems to be about selling something related to their stock and providing information on various financial symbols.

Looking at the first tweet: ""merck & co . evp adam schechter sells $ 642,719 in $ mrk url."" That's a bit confusing. The user is selling money from Merck's stock. So that directly affects their balance sheet by reducing cash. I should note this as a negative factor because it reduces equity.

Now the second tweet: ""the ' stock options 101 ' hd video package is 100 % free . url $ wfm $ ko $ mrk $ bmgp $ spg $ mnkd url."" This seems to be about stock options and providing information on different financial instruments. The mention of various symbols here doesn't indicate a clear positive or negative impact on Merck's stock directly.

I don't see any positive mentions in either tweet related to ""mrk"" except the first one, which is selling their stock. However, selling another company's stock typically has a negative effect on that company's balance sheet. Since both tweets are about trading actions on the same stock, it could influence the market but isn't a direct impact.

Considering both tweets are related to trading activities and not information that directly affects the valuation of ""mrk,"" I think they contribute to a less clear picture. It might be considered as neutral because while there are trade-related factors, there's no substantial positive or negative financial news from these tweets.

So, combining all these thoughts, it seems like there are selling activities on Merck's stock but nothing that would indicate a large shift in their valuation."
2015-05-14,Negative,"Okay, I need to determine the likely impact on the stock price of a company based on these tweets. Let's break it down step by step.

First, from the target stock symbol, which is missing here, but looking at the tweets, they're discussing energy stocks and something about big news breaking between $tlfx and $mrk. 

In tweet 1, there are mentions of energy trends, a bull trend with a 3x return, and it's related to daily energy prices. The tweet has some links and mentions of breaking into the breakout zone. I don't see any positive or negative terms here. It seems like a breakdown in the market for energy stocks.

Then, in tweet 2, there's an alert about $tlfx gaining 77% from last week, which is a significant increase. This sounds like positive news because it's showing a rise. However, this relates to the same stock as in tweet 1. So, combining these two tweets, the energy sector seems to be doing well.

I should assess each tweet's factors. For tweet 1, no direct mentions of positive or negative events except for the price movement and potential market breakdown, but that doesn't add positivity. Tweet 2 is clearly showing a rise in $tlfx, which could indicate good news for energy stocks, possibly positively affecting the target stock.

Since there are strong positive mentions, like a big price gain, it suggests increased investor interest or confidence in the sector. This would likely lead to an upward trend in the stock price."
2015-05-15,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price based on their provided information. Let me break down what I know.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""tim anderson sees merck coming out of sglt 2 safety woes with stronger januvia sales . $ mrk $ jnj $ lly"". The words mentioned are Merck (MRK), Januvius Sales, and the stock symbols MRK, JNJ, LLY. So, I think the target stock is Merck.

Next, I have to analyze each tweet individually and then combine the findings. 

The first tweet says that Tim Anderson sees Merck coming out of safety woes with stronger Januvius Sales. The sales figures mentioned are $334 for Amgen (AMGN) and $790 for Actavis (ACTVA). However, it seems like the sentiment is more about what's happening with Merck itself rather than other stocks listed here. So, I'm not sure if this tweet contributes to a positive or negative sentiment about Merck.

The second tweet mentions that RT AT_USER views today's pharma daily news round-up video, which includes names like Takeda (TKD), Amgen (AMGN), Actavis (ACTVA), and others. It also has stock symbols $MRK, $GLKQY. This seems similar to the first tweet but adds more context about a different company's news.

Both tweets are providing financial data for other companies, not Merck. They mention sales figures and safety issues, which can sometimes indicate positive or negative trends depending on the context. For example, if a company is facing issues that might improve their outlook, it could be a positive factor. However, without specific details about Merck's performance or recent events affecting them, it's hard to gauge the sentiment.

Since both tweets are about other companies and their financials, they don't directly provide information about Merck. They might support a certain investment strategy but aren't enough on their own to significantly impact stock prices unless there's a clear correlation. 

I'm leaning towards a Neutral overall sentiment because neither tweet provides strong evidence about how it will affect Merck's stock price."
2015-05-16,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the future stock price of the company. The user has provided two tweets, but they're cut off at the URL part. Let me try to parse what each tweet is saying.

First tweet: ""nPax network appliance , inc . quotes click here -> URL trending $ ntap $ oa $ tsl $ mrk ntap finance finance""

Hmm, this looks like an investment quote from NPAX. It mentions a stock symbol and several other stocks. The user might be suggesting that the company is doing well in the tech sector or perhaps as part of their broader portfolio. I should check if these factors are positive or negative for the stock price.

Second tweet: ""hayul hayul 1luckyjimmy : mack merrimack pharmaceuticals , inc . day low click here -> URL trending $ mack $ ddd $ lf $ mrk …""

This seems to be about a pharmaceutical company, MACK, and its stock is trending down. The term ""day low"" indicates that it's performing at the lower end of the market.

Now, combining both tweets. The first one talks about NPAX, which could either be positive or negative depending on broader market trends in tech. The second tweet is a standalone event affecting MACK, another company. Without context, it's hard to assess their impact on each other. However, if we consider these as separate tweets about different stocks, I can assess each one individually.

The first tweet suggests that NPAX is doing well, which could be positive for the overall tech sector and possibly its stock price. The second tweet indicates MACK is trending down, which might be negative for MACK's performance but could have implications for another company it operates with.

But since I don't know how these tweets are related or if they target the same company or different ones, I can only make assumptions. If both tweets mention the same stock, like NPAX and MACK, then their impacts might be interconnected. However, without more context, it's best to treat them as separate factors.

So, for each tweet:

1. ""nPax network appliance , inc . quotes click here -> URL trending $ ntap $ oa $ tsl $ mrk ntap finance finance"" – This could be a positive or negative factor. It mentions multiple stocks and the user might be suggesting that NPAX is performing well in its industry, which could affect its stock price positively.

2. ""hayul hayul 1luckyjimmy : mack merrimack pharmaceuticals , inc . day low click here -> URL trending $ mack $ ddd $ lf $ mrk …"" – This suggests that MACK is performing poorly in the financial sector, which might negatively impact its stock price.

Considering both factors separately, if NPAX is doing well and MACK is doing poorly, it's unclear how they would affect each other. However, without knowing their relationship or context, I can't combine them into a single sentiment for either stock.

Therefore, treating each tweet as separate, the first might be positive, and the second negative. So overall, if we have to decide based on these tweets alone, it's ambiguous, but perhaps leaning towards mixed."
2015-05-17,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided four tweets and asked for an overall assessment using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at each tweet, all of them mention ""mrk"" as the stock symbol. So, the stock in question is probably Microsoft or something similar.

Next, I'll break down each tweet for positive and negative factors. 

The first tweet says: ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER sell $ mrk ? $ 5.3 bn vaccine revenues , 13 % of sales , far from a 'rounding error'."" So, the user is selling stock, which would decrease their personal account, not the company's. That seems negative.

The second tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER sell $ mrk ? $ 5.3 bn vaccine revenues , 13 % of sales , far from a 'rounding error'. Let me focus on that part."" Again, it mentions selling stock and reports sales figures which might be positive or negative depending on the context. But since it's about revenues, if they're high, it could be good news for their personal account but not necessarily the company.

The third tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER sell $ mrk ? $ 5.3 bn vaccine revenues , 13 % of sales , far from a 'rounding error'. Focus on the first two sentences about selling stock and revenue figures. Positive or negative? Again, the main point is selling the stock, which is bad for their personal account.

The fourth tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER sell $ mrk ? $ 5.3 bn vaccine revenues , 13 % of sales , far from a 'rounding error'. Same as above—focusing on selling actions and revenue figures. The user's main action is selling their stock, which negatively impacts their personal account.

Now, combining all these tweets: the main action is selling stock, which decreases their personal account, potentially affecting their personal finances but not necessarily the company's financial health unless it indicates a strategic decision to reduce debt or cut costs by selling shares. However, since they're talking about vaccine revenues and sales figures, which are business-related, maybe positive, but the immediate impact from selling stock is negative.

So overall sentiment seems negative because they're selling the stock directly. That might indicate an intention to manage personal finances rather than to invest in the company's future performance."
2015-05-18,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on VEX's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. The tweets provided all mention ""VEX"" or similar symbols. Wait, looking again, the first tweet is about VEX, valued at $230.48, and others seem to be related to a company called VEX医药. So maybe I should note that as ""VEX Meditation Inc."" or something like that.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Positive factors might include VEX being in the media landscape with good news, increased demand for meditation products, etc. Negative factors could be stock performance, revenue growth, operational issues, etc.

Then, assess each factor's sentiment. For positive, how do the tweets feel? If they're encouraging or optimistic about future trends, that's positive. If the tweet seems negative about VEX, like a decline in stock prices, that's a clear negative. I should pay attention to whether there are any conflicting information.

Now, putting it all together: Look at each tweet, extract factors, note their sentiment, and aggregate them. Sum up if overall sentiment is positive (like increasing demand), neutral (balanced), or negative (declining).

I think the user might be looking for a quick assessment without getting into too much detail. Maybe they're trying to gauge VEX's momentum quickly.

So I'll go through each tweet one by one, extract factors, assess their sentiment, and then combine them to see if there's an overall positive, neutral, or negative outlook."

2015-05-20,Positive,"Okay, let me figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a set of tweets and asked me to analyze their impact on a stock's future price by categorizing them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. 

First, I need to identify the target stock. Looking at the tweets, they all mention ""brwc"" which might be the ticker symbol for a company. So, I'll focus on that.

Next, each tweet is an independent factor. For each one, I have to split them into Positive and Negative factors. Then assess the sentiment by evaluating how each tweet affects investor sentiment. 

Looking at the tweets:
1. The first tweet links to a blog titled ""brwc boreal water collection inc."" This seems like a positive statement because it's about the company and mentions their stock market updates.
2. The second tweet is a price increase alert, which indicates investors are concerned about the stock's performance.
3. The third tweet has an email link, suggesting they're offering a discount, which would typically be positive as it might boost prices.

Now, for each tweet:
1. Positive factors: The blog post could highlight good news or industry trends.
2. Negative factors: None immediately obvious here.
Sentiment assessment: The tweet is pushing investor confidence with an alert and a potential increase in stock price. So sentiment is Positive.

I'll go through each tweet similarly, but all of them are linked to positive messages about the company. Therefore, the overall impact is Positive because every relevant tweet adds to investor confidence or indicates good news."
2015-05-21,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Gilead, merck and achillion stocks based on their impact on future stock prices. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""gilead , merck and achillion / jnj square off in an hcv ' nuc ' lear showdown URL $ achn $ jnj $ mrk $ gild."" The key part here seems to be ""gilead"", but it's a bit ambiguous because there are other stocks mentioned. Maybe the symbol is Gilead? Or perhaps Gilead has some connection.

Next, I have to process each tweet individually. Since each tweet only mentions one stock at a time (like Gilead in this case), I can focus on that. So for ""gilead"", I need to look into what's happening with Gilead. But wait, the tweet is just about their showdown, which could mean something else entirely—maybe it's an unrelated event or a typo.

I remember that sometimes tweets can include stock symbols in the text if they're part of a quote or a specific scenario. So maybe ""gilead"" here isn't the company but perhaps a term used for another stock? Or is it a play on words? I'm not sure. It could be a trick question where Gilead refers to another company, like maybe ""Gilead Health""? But that seems less likely given the context of their showdown with Merck and Axillion.

Moving on to the next tweet: ""Negative"" from 3M. That's straightforward—the negative sentiment indicates they're seeing trouble with their operations or financials. This could affect investor confidence and stock price.

Then there are tweets mentioning Tesla, specifically stating that the Model 3 is rolling out. I know Tesla has been in the news recently regarding their production costs and revenue growth, so this positive tweet supports their stock performance because lower costs could improve profitability. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact market sentiment; I might need to check recent news articles on Tesla to see if there's any positive or negative indication.

I also have a tweet from 2nd amendment support mentioning ""gilead"". This could be pointing towards Gilead being involved in some financial activity, maybe as part of their business strategy. If they're related and working with investors, it might influence the stock price positively because it shows alignment between business decisions and company performance.

Another tweet is about the FDA approval for a new cancer drug. The FDA's role can sometimes signal positive developments that could boost stock prices, especially if the company is expected to go public soon. This looks like an investment-grade positive signal.

Now, putting this all together: Gilead might not be their actual stock but another entity with some connection. 3M's negative sentiment suggests they're struggling, which could cause the stock price to drop. Tesla rolling out a Model 3 is a positive sign because it can improve efficiency and lower costs, which are good for investors. The FDA approval could also trigger some interest in their new drug product.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure if ""gilead"" refers to Gilead Health or another company. If it's Gilead Health, that would be a different story. However, given the structure of the tweet, it seems like the keyword is ""gilead,"" which might mean something else. Maybe they're using a typo or different terminology.

Overall, while there are positive tweets about Tesla and potential business developments from FDA approvals, the main issue from 3M's negative sentiment likely has a more direct impact on Gilead's stock price. So, I think the overall sentiment is probably Negative because of the strong negative news from 3M."
2015-05-22,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price for the given company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. The tweet mentions ""our stock alerts gained over 1300% in less than 3 months!"" So that sounds positive because they're seeing significant gains. I'll note that as a strong positive.

Next, I see two factors mentioned: URL breakout $ insy and $ mrk. These might be screens or identifiers for specific stocks. However, without knowing which stock they refer to, it's hard to assess their impact individually. But since the main tweet mentions a 1300% gain, that's the primary factor.

Now, each tweet is labeled as Positive (P). Since both factors are positive in this case, combining them reinforces the overall sentiment.

I don't see any negative or neutral indicators here because there are no negative words. The focus is on positive performance metrics. So, the overall impact should be a positive.

Putting it all together, the significant positive gains and two positive identifiers point towards a strong [Positive] sentiment."
2015-05-23,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company. Let me start by understanding each tweet separately.

Looking at the first tweet: ""mrk merck & co . , inc . ask size URL $ mrk $ hca $ vz $ admd mrk tradeideas nasdaq"". The words mentioned are ""ask size,"" which probably means they're asking the user to provide a stock size, but that seems like an API request rather than a comment. I don't see any positive or negative sentiment here; it's more technical.

Now, the second tweet: ""merck : msd : reçoit de la part du chmp unavis favorable concernant le pemb ... URL $ mrk"". The user is saying they received favorable news about the company's president. Favorable news usually leads to positive emotions and increased demand for the stock. This seems like a strong positive sign that might boost the stock price.

I should consider if there are any other factors, but these two tweets don't mention anything else related to stock performance. Since one tweet is technical without sentiment and another indicates favorable news, combining them makes it more likely that the stock will go up."
2015-05-24,Missing,File not found
2015-05-25,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets are going to affect the stock price of a company. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. The target stock is alny alnylam pharmaceuticals. The first tweet says ""alny alnylam pharmaceuticals , inc . p / e ratio URL $ alny $ sxp.to $ vea $ mrk alny stocks pennystocks."" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. It mentions EBITP/E ratio, but I'm not sure what that stands for. Maybe it's something like earnings per share or something similar. Then it provides stock symbols, including alny, sxp.to, vea, mrk, alny stocks, pennystocks.

I think the EBITP/E ratio could be important because it relates to a company's profitability relative to its equity value. If that ratio is positive, it might indicate good earnings compared to the price paid for equity. But if it's negative, maybe investors are concerned about overpaying. However, without specific information on why these tweets mention pennystocks or other companies, I'm not sure if that adds anything.

Next tweet: ""alny alnylam pharmaceuticals , inc . p / e ratio URL $ alny $ sxp.to $ vea $ mrk alny stocks pennystocks"" – this seems repetitive. It's just repeating the first tweet again. So, it might not contribute new information but reinforce the same points about the EBITP/E.

Third tweet: ""alny alnylam pharmaceuticals , inc . p / e ratio URL $ alny $ sxp.to $ vea $ mrk alny stocks pennystocks"" – Again, same as before. No new data or insights here.

Fourth tweet: ""alny alnylam pharmaceuticals , inc . p / e ratio URL $ alny $ sxp.to $ vea $ mrk alny stocks pennystocks"" – Same structure and content as the first two tweets. It's just repeating, so I don't think it adds anything new to my analysis.

Putting it all together, these tweets seem to be a repeating repetition of information about an EBITP/E ratio and referencing some stock symbols but not giving any meaningful insights or predictions about the company's performance. Each tweet is just restating what's already said in the previous ones.

Given that none of these tweets provide any positive, negative, or neutral information about the stock, I think they won't have a significant impact on the stock price. Therefore, the overall sentiment should be neutral."
2015-05-26,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Merck (MRK). Let's go step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol: MRK. That's Merck, right? So I should focus on their performance. Now, the user provided two tweets. 

In the first tweet, it says ""stocktwits trending alert : trading recent interest in merck $ mrk URL"". Hmm, this seems like a call to action for someone to follow or trade. It's more about the current trends and their interest, not anything negative.

The second tweet is: ""mrk merck & co . , inc . bid URL $ mrk $ dgx $ hjoe $ sbux mrk tradeideas stock"". This looks like a bid query asking for the price of MRK. The user is trying to see if someone wants to buy their stock at $dgx. That's usually a positive action because it shows they're interested in purchasing.

So, putting this together: The first tweet is encouraging others to trade, which is generally positive. The second is a direct inquiry about the price of MRK. Both indicate that people are looking into buying or trading their stock, but the first is more promotional and the second is informational.

Both tweets don't show any negative indicators like warnings or concerns. They're just statements about interest in MRK's trends or potential purchases. There's no news or updated information affecting the stock price.

Therefore, I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment because both parts are showing interest and consideration for the stock."
2015-05-27,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for MCD. The user provided two specific tweets, so I'll start by looking at each one individually.

First, tweet number 1 says: ""rt AT_USER dogs of the dow update : URL $ t $ vz $ cvx $ cat $ mcd $ ge $ pfe $ mrk $ ko $ xom $ spy $ djia"". Hmm, that looks like it's related to stock symbols and maybe some keywords. The words include MCD (MSFT), GE (GE), PFE (PFE), MRK (MR), KO (KO), etc. It doesn't seem to specify any specific action or event, so I'm not sure what this tweet is about. Maybe it's a general update? If that's the case, I can't really determine how it affects MCD's stock price because there's no context.

Now, looking at tweet number 2: ""rt rt whaleoptions : unusualoptionsactivity 5/26 : $ swks $ cag $ trn $ ccj $ ctl $ gpro $ bmy $ mrk $ kors $ twtr $ hznp $ vz … URL"". This one seems more specific. It mentions ""whaleoptions"" and talks about their activity on the 5th of June. I know that whale trading involves buying stocks with a view to trade them for higher prices later, which can significantly impact stock prices. If whale options are being exercised or if there's increased demand for these options, it could push up the stock price because investors are betting on big moves in the sector.

Putting this together, tweet 2 seems like a potential source of information that could affect MCD. The mention of whales trading and option activity might indicate investor sentiment towards certain stocks, possibly influencing MCD's valuation. However, without more context or specific data points, it's hard to say for sure if there's a positive, negative, or neutral impact. It leans more into speculative trading rather than a direct financial impact.

So, considering both tweets, I can't confidently assign a single sentiment level because tweet 1 is too vague and tweet 2 involves speculative trading which isn't directly linked to the stock price but could be a signal for investors."
2015-05-28,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The tweet says ""merck & co $ mrk shares climb 0.34 % to $ 59.66"". Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I should identify the target stock symbol here. The keyword is ""mrk"", so that must be Merck & Co's stock. Now, looking at the tweet, it mentions a 0.34% increase in shares and the stock price dropping to $59.66 from presumably an initial higher value. But wait, the exact starting point isn't given. If we assume the share price was higher before this change, like maybe around $60 or more, then an increase of 0.34% would actually make it a bit higher, not lower.

So, if the stock went up by 0.34%, that's positive news for investors. It could mean they're happy with the company's performance and are looking to buy more shares. That generally leads to a positive sentiment because people tend to buy more when prices go up.

I should consider factors like financials, company strategy, expansion plans, or any other positive developments mentioned elsewhere that might be influencing this tweet. But since it only mentions the stock price increasing, without specific details on what changed, I'll focus on the given information.

Putting it all together, a 0.34% increase in shares to $59.66 suggests the company is doing well enough to make a small profit or have positive growth metrics. Therefore, this should lead to a Positive sentiment regarding future stock performance."
2015-05-29,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given information. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

The first tweet is ""our pick on $ vgtl closed up 28.57 % yesterday & saw it's highest volume in 10 years ! big news : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"". The key points here are that the stock VGTOL closed up a significant percentage, reached the highest volume over ten years, and there were major updates related to URLs breaking out of the company. These factors suggest positive indicators for investor confidence because higher volumes mean increased interest or attention. The closing up 28.57% is substantial, which might indicate good performance. So, from this tweet alone, it looks like there's a positive sentiment.

The second tweet is ""mrk merck & co . , inc . 52wk high URL $ mrk $ ua $ vrx $ ewh mrk share stocks"". The main elements here are that the company MRK/ Merck & Co. has had a 52-week high share price, and it's associated with various URLs like $mrk, $ua, etc. High stock prices in this context usually indicate good performance or earnings, which can positively impact investor sentiment. The mention of URLs suggests they might be related to the company's products or services, so if those URLs are relevant, it could lead to increased interest and stock value.

Putting these together, both tweets indicate positive signals about the company. The VGTOL tweet points towards a strong performance due to volume and closing gains. The MRK/ Merck & Co. tweet suggests growth potential as seen through high share prices and possibly related URLs. Therefore, combining these factors would result in a positive overall sentiment."
2015-05-30,Neutral,"Alright, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock price. The user provided five tweets and specified an output format with just one line stating ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking through them, I see mentions of BRistol, TESaro, Keytruda, pembrolizumab, and asco mrk. But wait, I'm not familiar with all these stocks. For example, BRistol isn't a well-known company, and Keytruda seems to be in biopharmaceuticals or maybe cancer research given the drug results mentioned.

Next, each tweet needs to be broken down into factors—positive and negative. Let's take the first one: ""bristol ’ s shares take hit from cancer-drug results - wsj $ bmy $ mrk url"". Here, it mentions cancer-drug results, which could imply positive if they're related to a business or a successful drug, but without more context, it's hard to say. It's also linked to two companies, BMY and MRK, which might have their own performance.

The second tweet is "" $ tsro $ mrk : tesaro and merck to collaborate on a combination study of ... : url"". This seems like it's talking about collaboration between tesaro and merck, so positive if that suggests a joint venture or partnership. 

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER asco 15 $ mrk keytruda very impressive data in mmr-deficient crc , smart with an established biomarker url"". Here, the user is mentioning ASCO 15 shares with Keytruda and MRK, focusing on something called MMR-deficient CRCs. This looks like a positive sign about a company's success or potential breakthrough.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER pembrolizumab in sclc in keynote - 028 : orr 35 % . 7 prs . 1 pt died from gr 5 colitis under investigation . asco 15 $ mrk url"". This is about pembrolizumab, a drug used in cancer treatment. The mention of studies and potential data under investigation adds some uncertainty; it's not clear if this is positive or negative.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER asco 15 $ mrk keytruda data in mmr-deficient crc in nejm url amazing true predictive biomarker ! url"". Similar to the third one, it mentions ASCO and KEYTRUDA, with an emphasis on MMR-deficient CRCs. The link to NEJM is a good sign for positive trends.

Now, combining all these factors: TESaro collaboration (positive), Keytruda's success in mmr-crcs (good), pembrolizumab study under investigation but promising signs (mixed), ASCO and KEYTRUDA with positive data. However, the lack of specific patient outcomes from the 35% death rate is a red flag for negative sentiment.

Putting it all together: Positive aspects include successful collaborations and biomarker successes. Negative could be the low mortality rate in the pembrolizumab study. So overall, there's some good news but a bit of uncertainty."
2015-05-31,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets about a company's stock price based on the given criteria. The user provided three tweets and asked me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of impact on the stock.

First, let's identify the target stock from the tweets. In all three tweets, they mention ""asco"" as the stock symbol, so I'll focus on ASCO.

Now, for each tweet:

1. The first tweet says ASCO has some exciting data, mentioning $ mrk, keytruda, mmr-deficient URL, and others. It doesn't have explicit positive or negative language but talks about ""exciting"" data. That could imply good news, which might be a sign of confidence, so I'll mark this as Positive.

2. The second tweet lists the company's stock symbol multiple times (4wins, dxj stocks) and mentions hedged equity. While it's hedged, it also says "" wisdom tree."" The word ""hedged"" sometimes refers to financial strategies but could be seen as a cautious approach. However, since ASCO doesn't mention anything negative, I'll consider this Neutral.

3. The third tweet discusses immuno-onc combinations and their price. It mentions biomarkers via AT_USER. This seems like it's talking about the company's performance in specific areas without any positive or negative language. So, marking this as Neutral makes sense because there's no indication of improvement or decline.

Combining these thoughts: Positive from the first tweet, Neutral from the second and third tweets. Since not all are Positive, I think the overall impact is Neutral."
2015-06-01,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given instructions.

First, let's break down what each tweet is about. 

1. The first tweet asks if high prices of cancer drugs can be contained, which seems more like a question or statement rather than something influencing investor sentiment.
2. The second tweet mentions free stock options but doesn't provide specifics that would indicate positive or negative impact on the stock price.
3. The third tweet talks about creditsuisse and Imuno-oncology, suggesting some opportunity, possibly positive.
4. The fourth tweet is a update with a percentage increase for platinum members, which might seem like a good thing to see an improvement.
5. The fifth tweet discusses a report card regarding some companies, but again, not providing specific data or impact on the stock price.
6. The sixth tweet talks about electronic arts and market cap, which might indicate some industry focus but doesn't directly relate to the stock.
7. The seventh tweet is about Merck & Co's summary, which could imply potential investment opportunities.

Considering each tweet: 
- Tweets 1 and 5 don't seem to provide direct information or impact on the stock price.
- Tweets 3, 4, and 7 talk about companies that might be related to the stock in question. For example, Merck & Co is a well-known company with a strong stock price.

However, without specific details about how these tweets influence investor sentiment, like if they mention positive news, indicate better valuations, or suggest potential buy/sell signals, it's hard to quantify a positive or negative impact.

I think the safest conclusion here might be neutral because we don't have enough information from the tweets to make a clear judgment. The other tweets are speculative or provide vague data that doesn't directly relate to the stock price movements."
2015-06-02,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the impact on the stock price of the company based on the provided tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I have to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""bsx boston scientific corp . quotes URL $ bsx $ mrk $ brcm $ shak bsx tradeideas share"". It seems like the stock symbol is ""mrk"" because it's followed by a dot and other words, which likely stands for Microsoft. So I'm focusing on Microsoft.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet separately. 

The first tweet says: ""bsx boston scientific corp . quotes URL $ bsx $ mrk $ brcm $ shak bsx trade ideas share"". This doesn't provide any positive or negative info about the stock. It mentions some other companies and stock symbols, but no direct mention of Microsoft. So I'll mark this tweet as neutral.

The second tweet: ""AT_USER $ mrk your tweet has been featured on market parse , for iPhone . URL"" Again, it's about Microsoft, but again, no specific positive or negative information is given here. It mentions that the user's tweet was featured on a platform related to the stock and links to an iPhone. Since there's nothing more, I'll consider this neutral.

Third tweet: ""weekly s & p 100 stocks performance $ lly $ ebay $ oxy $ mrk $ abbv $ gild $ dow $ cmcsa $ sbux $ intc $ gm $ mdlz $ dd more @ URL"" This one talks about the performance of several S&P 500 stocks. The tweet includes a list, but I don't see any positive or negative keywords related to Microsoft. It mentions things like stock performance and other companies. So again, no specific information on Microsoft's status, so this is neutral.

Fourth tweet: ""we have huge new penny stock picks coming ! become a platinum member to get them early : URL break out $ insy $ mrk"" This one clearly refers to a penny stock, which are stocks at lower valuations. It mentions breaking out in the market and offering a Platinum membership. The mention of ""penny stocks"" might give some indication that this could be an upward trend. So I'll mark this as positive.

Now, combining all four tweets: two neutral, one positive, and none positive or negative. Since there's at least one positive tweet and no strong negatives, the overall sentiment is positive."
2015-06-03,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze how the given tweet affects the stock price for a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, identifying the target stock symbol from the tweets is straightforward—looking at each tweet, the stocks mentioned are SHGRK and MRK. The user provided both companies separately, so I'll tackle them one by one.

Now, looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ cldx cdx - 011 glemba ( triple neg breast cancer ) could be ~ $ 400-500 m market in the us per jefferies call $ mrk $ shpg $ rhhby"". I notice that it mentions the US market with a specific range of $400-$500 million. This seems like an earnings report, possibly about double-digit growth or some positive metric. However, the mention of ""could be"" suggests uncertainty.

Next, looking at the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ cldx cdx - 011 glemba ( triple neg breast cancer ) could be ~ $ 400-500 m market in the us per jefferies call $ mrk $ shpg $ rhhby"". Similar structure, same information but with ""could be"" again. Again, mentions US market performance.

Both tweets are indicating a positive outlook on the US market for both SHGRK and MRK, providing specific numbers to gauge potential earnings or revenue growth. The words like ""market in the us per"" and ""$ 400-500 m"" suggest confidence that these companies will perform well there. 

Considering the factors: positive mentions of earnings expectations, market performance projections, and investor sentiment on future gains. All points lean towards a favorable assessment. So, combining them, the stock's overall impact should be positive."
2015-06-04,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price for [Insightful Tech]. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the target stock is Insightful Tech. The user provided a tweet: ""our penny stock alerts gained over 3400 % for subscribers in 7 months ! see our new picks : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"". So, I need to extract the stock symbol from this. Hmm, the key part here seems to be the symbols $ insy and $ mrk. Wait, Insightful Tech is known as INTC. Let me check if $ insy is Insy Corporation or something else. Oh, wait, $ insy might be a typo for Insightful Technologies (INFY), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the symbols are separate, like $INTC and $MRK? That could represent different companies.

But given that it's about stock alerts gaining 3400%, I think the primary symbol involved here is probably Insightful Technologies. So, I'll assume the target stock is INFY (Insightful Technologies).

Next, I need to parse each tweet for factors and sentiment. The provided tweet has two mentions: ""pennys"" and ""new picks"". Wait, pennies are often related to stocks with low P/E ratios. But this seems like a tweet about alerts for subscribers in 7 months, so it's about stock performance.

The tweet says the penny stock (probably Insightful) gained over 3400% for subscribers in 7 months and sees new picks: URL breakout $ insy $ mrk. The word "" breakout"" might indicate a positive move. So, I'm leaning towards a Positive sentiment here because of the high percentage gain.

I don't see any negative factors mentioned; it's all about gains. Therefore, combining these thoughts, the overall impact is positive."
2015-06-05,Missing,File not found
2015-06-06,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided some tweets and asked me to evaluate each one step by step. Let's start by understanding what they're asking for.

First, looking at the target stock symbol mentioned in the tweets: roche. But wait, actually, I'm not given a specific stock; maybe that was just part of the problem description. Hmm, no, the actual output is to decide whether each tweet affects the overall stock's future price, either positive, neutral, or negative.

Wait, no, looking again, the tweets all start with ""roche on the wrong side for once in shifting analyst forecasts URL $ ibb $ rhhbf $ rhhby $ vrtx $ mrk $ nvs $ gild $ atvbf"". That's confusing. Maybe the stock symbol is roche? Or perhaps it's not part of the problem. The user says ""Analyze the provided tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a given company."" So I'm probably supposed to assume that each tweet corresponds to a specific stock.

But then, in the output requirement, they specify using one of three tags: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. So perhaps for each tweet, I need to decide if it contributes positively, neutrally, or negatively to the company's stock performance. Then sum up all these opinions across multiple tweets to get an overall sentiment.

But wait, looking at the provided tweets, they seem like they could be unrelated. Let me parse them again:

1. roche on the wrong side for once in shifting analyst forecasts URL $ ibb $ rhhbf $ rhhby $ vrtx $ mrk $ nvs $ gild $ atvbf

Hmm, each tweet seems to end with a URL starting with ""roche,"" but that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's an incorrect reference or typo.

Wait, perhaps the stock symbol is roche, and these tweets are about something related to roche's performance? Or maybe the stock being referred to is not specified here. The output requires using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative] as tags for each tweet relative to a given company.

But without knowing which company the user is referring to, I can't evaluate the sentiment accurately because the tweets are just about the roche part. Unless there's some context missing in the problem statement that defines the target stock.

Alternatively, maybe the tweets are all unrelated and have no impact on any stock's price. In that case, each tweet would be [Neutral], but since I can't infer the company from this text, it might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in the tweets. Maybe they intended to refer to different stocks? Let me check:

The tweets are all starting with ""roche on..."", so unless there's more context or if the stock is spelled out elsewhere, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, maybe each tweet is about a different company, but the user wants an overall sentiment for one specific stock. Without knowing which stock it is, I can't assess it.

Given that, perhaps the response should say [Neutral] because without knowing the stock, it's impossible to evaluate the impact. But that might not be helpful since the problem likely implies a single stock.

Alternatively, maybe the target stock is ""Roche"" and these tweets are about its performance over time or something else, but they don't seem to fit into any standard financial metrics I know.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe each tweet represents a different factor influencing the stock price. For example, if one tweet says ""Positive growth in Q1,"" another says ""Negative due to market downturn,"" and so on, then combining these would give the overall impact.

But since all tweets start with roche, it's unclear who the target company is. Maybe I need to infer from context or assume a default.

Alternatively, maybe the user provided some specific stock details in the problem statement that weren't included here, but only part of the query text. It's possible that the user expects me to identify the stock symbol based on the tweets and then evaluate each tweet against it, but since they didn't provide that information, I can't proceed.

Hmm, perhaps I need to respond by indicating that without knowing the target stock or context, it's impossible to determine the sentiment. But the user wants a single line with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative], so maybe just [Neutral] is the safest assumption since there's no data provided about any stock.

Alternatively, maybe all these tweets are part of an analysis where each represents a different factor for a specific company, and collectively they contribute to the overall impact. But again, without knowing the target stock, it's speculative.

In conclusion, I think the best approach is to respond with [Neutral] because there's no context or data provided about the target stock whose tweets are being evaluated here."

2015-06-08,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for the stock price impact.

First, I need to identify the target stock mentioned in each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ celg $ mrk as suitor"". ""celg"" might be a typo or misspelling of ""curl"", which stands for a company. So it's probably pointing towards ""curl"" and ""mrk"", which could be ""msft"". 

The second tweet is ""$ celg heating up that $ mrk rumor has some legs"". It mentions that ""celg is heating up"" implying the price might rise, and there's a rumor about ""mrk"" (maybe ""msft"") being in trouble. That sounds like good news for investors.

The third tweet: ""3,500 % gains in 8 months & more stock picks on the way ! subscribe here to get them early : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". It's talking about big gains over a short period and mentions new stock picks. This seems positive because it shows potential growth.

So all three tweets are positive, each hinting at favorable news for the stock. The first one points directly to a company name, which is good information. The second one talks about a rumor, but it's framed as something positive—hiring people and seeing gains. The third tweet gives a clear, strong outlook on future performance.

Therefore, combining these factors suggests that the stock is expected to be positively influenced by these tweets."
2015-06-09,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Ford. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at them one by one:

1. ""f ford motor co . % change URL $ f $ tasr $ xom $ mrk f stocks share"" – This seems to be about Ford's performance. The symbol here is mrk.
2. ""mrk merck & co . , inc . bid size URL $ mrk $ fb $ mrk $ cvx mrk share nasdaq"" – Another mention of FORD, so mrk again.
3. ""rt AT_USER hjoe hangover joe's holding corp . bid size URL $ hjoe $ bad.to $ mrk $ pfe hjoe stock stockmarket"" – This tweet mentions Mrk, but it's part of a larger discussion about Mrk's stock and is linked to a user named hjoe.
4. ""3,500 % gains in 8 months & more stock picks on the way ! subscribe here to get them early : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"" – Again, mentions FORD (lgnd) and talks about stock picks.

So, all tweets mention Mrk, which I assume is Ford. Now, I need to analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors. 

1. ""f ford motor co . % change URL $ f $ tasr $ xom $ mrk f stocks share"" – This seems positive because it's about FORD and mentions market shares.
2. ""mrk merck & co . , inc . bid size URL $ mrk $ fb $ mrk $ cvx mrk share nasdaq"" – Also positive, indicating that Mrk is increasing in value.
3. ""rt AT_USER hjoe hangover joe's holding corp .bid size URL $ hjoe $ bad.to $ mrk $ pfe hjoe stock stockmarket"" – This seems neutral as it mentions Mrk and talks about a user, not an opinion on the stock.
4. ""3,500 % gains in 8 months & more stock picks on the way ! subscribe here to get them early : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"" – Positive because it's talking about gains over time.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet is positive, the second also is positive. However, the third isn't too strong, and the fourth is definitely positive. There are no negative tweets here. So overall sentiment seems positive."

2015-06-11,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on a given company's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the target stock is. Looking at the tweets, they all mention $ mrk and other companies like $ ppch, $ insy, etc. It seems like the main focus of these tweets is on $ mrk, so that's my target stock.

Now, each tweet is a separate piece of information. I'll go through them one by one to identify positive or negative factors.

1. The first tweet says that $ ppch is a fast-moving penny stock this month and mentions URLs for the stocks. It seems like it's talking about upcoming moves or new picks.
2. The second tweet talks about our stock alert gaining over 1300% in under three months and lists some pickups, including URL breakout with $ insy and $ mrk.
3. The third tweet is from RVNC, Inc., mentioning their change to a different URL and the share trade ideas.
4. Another tweet about $ ppch with similar sentiments as the first one.
5. A tweet from AT_USER mentions that his tweet about $ mrk had a sentiment of 5 and was featured on market parse.

Hmm, some tweets mention advancements in stocks, others talk about alerts gaining a lot in a short time. The sentiment seems positive because the companies are showing growth potential or upcoming moves. 

Looking at each tweet: the first is just a general update about moving pennies. The second one specifically talks about our stock alert having high returns and mentioning picks. The third is about another company changing their URL but not necessarily impacting the target stock here. The fourth is repeating the positive sentiment of the first tweet.

The fifth tweet from AT_USER mentions that his tweet's sentiment was 5, which I think refers to a strong or confident opinion, and it was featured on market parse. That suggests high engagement or support among investors.

Putting this together, all tweets are positive because they either talk about upcoming stocks showing gains, indicating confidence in their potential success, or highlight positive developments that could drive the stock price up. There's no negative information here; everything is looking promising for $ mrk and possibly other companies mentioned."
2015-06-12,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. Let me start by understanding what each tweet says.

The first tweet is about $ ppch being a fast-moving penny stock. It mentions it's one of them this month and provides updates for two companies: $ mrk (which I think is March)\$ and $ lgnd (\$). So, it's talking about their performance on the penny market. 

Now, to determine how each tweet affects investor sentiment, I need to consider what each company does. Both $ mrk and $ lgnd are penny stocks, so they probably have higher valuations. Since they're fast-moving, meaning they can increase in value quickly after a price drop, this might indicate good news for investors looking to profit from the stock's strong fundamentals.

I also notice that the user is updating their Twitter accounts with stock prices and company names. This could mean they're monitoring the penny market or the companies for potential buy interest. Investors often follow up on stock information when there are updates about price changes, so this tweet might indicate confidence in their future performance.

Considering both positive factors like being fast-moving and potentially strong fundamentals from these companies, I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment. The user is providing relevant information that could influence investor expectations."

2015-06-14,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of frcn. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""frcn firemans contractors inc . open URL $ frcn $ drt.to $ emc $ mrk frcn stocks nasdaq."" The company name seems to be ""frcn firemans contractors inc."" So, I'll note that as the target stock.

Next, each tweet provides information about this stock. The second tweet is more detailed: ""$ mrk $ pfe news : ' 3 % to near - 5 % yields for top 10 dow dividend june dogs $ cat …' URL analyze : URL."" Here, ""mrk"" stands out, which likely refers to frcn's stock symbol. So the target stock is still frcn firemans contractors inc.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors and assess sentiment towards the stock price. The first tweet doesn't mention any specific trends or financial performance indicators. It just provides a URL. Since there's no clear information about the company's performance, it's hard to gauge sentiment from this one.

The second tweet talks about dividend yields in June, mentions ""top 10 Dow dividends,"" and uses the word ""dog"" which might be a playful nod or typo. The mention of dividends could influence investor sentiment negatively if they expect strong growth. However, without specific data on actual performance, it's speculative. I'll have to consider both factors but with limited information.

Since the first tweet doesn't provide any relevant info about frcn's financials or market position, I can only rely on the second tweet for a general assessment. The sentiment is influenced by potential future dividend payments and earnings, which could impact stock price. If investors expect strong dividends in June, it might be seen as positive, but with uncertainty, this could lead to a slight negative effect.

Putting it all together, without concrete data from the first tweet, I can't make an absolute conclusion. The second tweet's sentiment leans towards potential dividend growth, which could either positive or neutral, depending on expectations. But considering possible market reactions and lack of specific data, my initial assessment might lean toward a Neutral or Negative stance.

Wait, but the user is asking for one final line, so I should make a decision based on all factors. Maybe the negative impact because dividend yields are uncertain? Or positive because potential growth could boost the stock? I'm torn here. However, since there's limited info and the second tweet's sentiment isn't clear beyond dividend expectations, it might be best to go with Neutral."
2015-06-15,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user has provided two specific tweets and wants me to evaluate their likely effect. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER warning : top healthcare performers now overvalued URL $ mrk $ ibb $ iyh $ xlv $ xbi $ vht $ pjp $ bbh $ fbt $ hq …"". The stock symbol here is mrk, which I believe stands for Marvel. So, the target stock is Marvel.

Now, moving on to tweet 2: ""uup powershares db us dollar index bullish fund bid size URL $ uup $ tpac $ cur $ mrk uup invest share"". This tweet seems to be discussing a fund that has a bullish outlook on the dollar index. The keywords here include bullish, dollar index, and possibly some stock movements.

The user's task is to analyze each tweet to determine if it contributes positively, neutrally, or negatively to the stock price. They also mentioned identifying factors (positive/negative) and sentiment of each tweet before combining them into an overall sentiment summary.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions that top healthcare performers are overvalued on Marvel. This could imply that the stock might be undervalued if other investors think they're too high. However, there's a warning attached from AT_USER, which might indicate uncertainty or concern about the stock performance. So, I'm leaning towards this being a negative factor because it's raising doubts about the stock's value.

Next, tweet 2 talks about a bullish fund on the dollar index and mentions Marvel (mrk) as a potential investment. A bullish outlook typically indicates good news for investors, which would generally be positive. However, the specific context of the bull fund and its performance isn't entirely clear without more information. It's possible that this is reinforcing some investor sentiment towards Marvel or the broader market.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet raises concerns about the stock's valuation, suggesting it's not as strong as expected, which could lead to negative sentiment. However, the second tweet adds a bullish perspective from a fund that might attract more investors. There's uncertainty here because Twitter is known for its fast-paced updates and sometimes conflicting information.

I need to weigh these factors. The warning in tweet 1 is a bit contradictory because it mentions overvalued healthcare performers but doesn't specify if Marvel is part of the Healthcare segment or otherwise. If it's an oversight, that could be neutral. On the other hand, the bullish fund might indicate confidence, which would lean towards positive.

I'm also considering the potential context—without more information about the broader market or any news related to Marvel, it's hard to pin down a single sentiment. It seems like there's both contradicting and reinforcing pieces here.

Maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because while some factors are positive, others present conflicting information that makes the picture uncertain. But sometimes, even if things seem mixed, certain aspects can still lean towards one thing.

I'm also thinking about whether the bull fund's performance could affect other areas of Marvel or the company as a whole, which might have implications beyond just stock price movements. However, unless more details are provided about these factors, it's hard to make a definitive conclusion.

In conclusion, given the conflicting signals from both tweets and the potential for various interpretations, I think the overall sentiment is [Neutral]. There's some positive indication from the bullish fund but also concerns regarding overvaluation in healthcare performers. These two aspects could offset each other, leaving the stock price uncertain."
2015-06-16,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user provided four tweets and specified to use one of three responses: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet number 1: ""axpw axion power intl . , inc . bid URL $ axpw $ xbit $ mrk $ qld axpw finance share."" It seems to mention a few symbols like X_bitcoin and Qld, so maybe the stock is X_bitcoin? That makes sense because it's mentioned as a financial share.

Next, I need to perform a tweet-by-tweet analysis. For each tweet, I should separate the factors (Positive and Negative) and assess the sentiment towards the overall market or the specific stock.

Let me go through each tweet one by one:

1. ""axpw axion power intl . , inc . bid URL $ axpw $ xbit $ mrk $ qld axpw finance share""

This tweet is a bit confusing because it has multiple symbols and mentions several stocks. It seems to present information about X_bitcoin, Qld, and maybe others, but without specific context or quotes, it's hard to determine sentiment. However, the presence of ""bid URL"" might indicate investor interest in buying shares, which could be positive.

2. ""axpw axion power intl . , inc . bid URL $ axpw $ xbit $ mrk $ qld axpw finance share""

This looks similar to the first tweet but with a different keyword order. Again, without additional context or quotes, it's challenging to gauge sentiment. However, if this tweet is responding to previous mentions, it might support the stock's value.

3. ""axpw axion power intl . , inc . bid URL $ axpw $ xbit $ mrk $ qld axpw finance share""

Another similar tweet, possibly a follow-up or response to the first one. This suggests that investors are interested in X_bitcoin and related stocks, which is positive.

4. ""axpw axion power intl . , inc . bid URL $ axpw $ xbit $ mrk $ qld axpw finance share""

This seems repetitive, possibly a continuation of the previous ones. It likely indicates continued interest and positive sentiment towards the stock.

Considering all four tweets, they are all in the same format and mention X_bitcoin, which is likely the target stock. Each tweet seems to support the stock's value with information that might be indicative of investor confidence or interest. 

Without specific quotes or numbers from each tweet, it's a bit challenging to assess sentiment accurately, but given the structure and repetition, it suggests a positive overall sentiment."
2015-06-17,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet is ""mdco medicines co . day high URL $ mdco $ mco $ mrk $ swks mdco stockmarket stocks"". The word ""high"" here might indicate a strong positive outlook, so that's a good sign for the stock price. It mentions multiple symbols like mdco, mco, mrk, swks which could mean they're tracking different aspects or products.

Second tweet is ""amd advanced micro devices , inc . prev close URL $ amd $ blue $ iwm $ mrk amd share share"". The word ""prev close"" usually means the price before closing, and mentions multiple symbols again. It might be showing some form of stock activity but not necessarily a significant positive or negative trend.

Looking at both tweets together, the first one is more about the outlook, which tends to have a positive impact on investor sentiment. The second tweet seems slightly more negative because it's talking about past shares and mentions iwm and amd. However, since the first tweet is more about future expectations, its influence might be more pronounced.

I'm leaning towards a positive overall sentiment because the first tweet provides strong forward-looking information, which generally boosts stock prices. The second tweet adds some context but doesn't have as much weight compared to the first one."
2015-06-18,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on Merck's stock price. The first tweet mentions receiving new coverage at Piper Jaffray with a URL. I think this is positive because getting additional information could influence investor confidence. The second tweet says research coverage started, which might also boost confidence. Both seem supportive and provide valuable info, so the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-06-19,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the company. 

First, looking at the target stock symbol, it seems like ""mrk"" because that's a commonly used abbreviation for ""Master Opportunities Research"". So, the stock in question is likely referred to as ""Mrk stocks"".

Now, I need to break down each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says: ""$ mrk - why bristol-myers squibb co . ' s stock could sink URL"". Hmm, that seems a bit off. The mention of ""bristol"" and ""myers squibb co."" is unusual. Maybe it's a typo or irrelevant information. I'll note this as possibly unrelated.

The second tweet reads: ""our stock pick on $ mjmj gained as much as 145 % from it's low this week ! big news : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". Okay, so the user is talking about their stock picking and mentions a significant increase of 145% from a low. Also, they link to ""URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"", which seems like new information.

I should extract the key points here. The tweet mentions that their stock picked up a lot—specifically, an increase of 145%. That's a big positive move in absolute terms. 

Looking at the other tweets, there are none, so I only have two relevant ones. But one is somewhat nonsensical about ""bristol"" and ""myers squibb"". Let me focus on the meaningful part.

The first tweet talks about the stock possibly sinking, which could mean it's performing poorly, but the second tweet provides a strong positive note with an 145% increase. Even though one tweet is confusing, the other clearly mentions a big news event regarding the stock performance.

Given that the user is talking about their pick increasing by 145%, this indicates strong confidence or support among investors. This is a clear indicator of positive sentiment. The mention of URL stocks might indicate broader market expectations or news related to the company.

So, combining all these factors—positive news from the tweet and the context of stock performance—the overall impact seems to be a significant boost to the stock price."
2015-06-20,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of an ORCL company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the first tweet: ""orcl oracle corp . short sales URL"". Hmm, that doesn't seem related to a known company. Maybe it's a typo or irrelevant information. I'll have to consider this as no significant impact since the symbol isn't part of the ORCL context.

Next, the second tweet mentions PFEZ and MRK in oncology. That's unrelated to ORCL either. So, probably nothing here that affects ORCL's stock price.

Looking at the third tweet: ""rt AT_USER % of pd-l 1 expression by tumor type $ mrk $ bmy $ afmd $ agen checkpoints URL"". I'm not familiar with these companies (MRK is maybe an acronym for something). This seems like it could be unrelated, possibly a typo or irrelevant information.

The fourth tweet talks about our stock picking on $ mjmj gained as much as 145% from low this week. Wait, $ mjmj doesn't make sense. Maybe that's a typo and should be something else related to ORCL? If it was about MRK, which is often involved in gene therapy, then a 145% increase could indicate strong performance. But if it's actually some other stock, like $mkmj or something else unrelated, the impact might be negligible.

Putting this together, none of these tweets seem to directly mention ORCL. Some are about other companies, which don't provide relevant information for the stock price of ORCL. The only tweet that might have a slight positive note is the fourth one, but it's unclear what $mjmj refers to since it doesn't correspond to any known company. Without concrete evidence or significant updates related to ORCL, I can't conclude a clear impact on its future stock price.

Therefore, after analyzing each tweet, the overall sentiment remains [Neutral] because none of them provide meaningful information about ORCL."
2015-06-21,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, from the provided tweets, I can extract the target stock symbol. The first tweet mentions ""mrk"" and other symbols like ""nasdaq stocks,"" so that must be related to Microsoft. The second tweet is about ""loser = $ mrk URL."" The third mentions ""tasr taser intl inc."" and includes ""mrk.""

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. The first one says ""prp / curl analysis : loser = $ mrk URL."" This seems like a performance indicator where if ""loser"" is the stock price, it's suggesting that the stock might be down or has been in a bad trend.

2. The second tweet ""tasr taser intl inc ."" doesn't seem to provide any specific information about the stock. It mentions something about 'loser' but isn't tied directly to Microsoft.

3. The third tweet ""tasr taser intl inc ."" again seems similar, just repeating the same info without adding context on the stock. No specifics here either.

Next, I need to assess factors and sentiment for each tweet. For the first tweet, ""prp / curl analysis : loser = $ mrk URL"" likely relates to technical analysis where a losing indicator suggests the stock might be down. This could affect investor confidence, leading to potential downward sentiment.

For the second and third tweets, since they mention 'tasr taser intl inc.' without specifics on the company or stock symbol, it's hard to determine their impact. They don't provide any information that directly relates to Microsoft's performance, so I can only assume uncertainty or lack of specific context.

Combining these factors, the first tweet introduces a potential negative factor (""loser""), which might reduce investor confidence. The second and third tweets are too vague for analysis. So overall, it seems there's some negative indication but not enough specifics to definitively assess as positive or neutral."

2015-06-24,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out whether the given tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on a company's stock price.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the tweets: It seems to be ""mrk"" since both tweets mention it after some other words. So, I'll focus on how these tweets affect mrk.

For each tweet, I need to identify the Positive and Negative factors. Let me take the first tweet: ""ung united states natural gas fund current price URL $ ung $ mrk $ paas $ jnj ung finance stock"". Hmm, this is a bit confusing because it's a URL with some words in quotes. Wait, maybe it's just listing out information or prices? The word ""mrk"" appears here as well: ""ung $ mrk $..."" So perhaps the tweet is stating something about the current price of mrk?

But wait, the second tweet says: ""blue bluebird bio inc . summary URL $ blue $ rsp $ mrk $ symx blue finance share"". Again, it mentions ""mrk"", and it's a different stock. This makes me realize that both tweets are about two different stocks. The first is ""ung"" which might be another company, perhaps unrelated, while the second is about ""blue bluebird bio inc."" So each tweet seems to be focusing on one stock.

Wait, but the output is for the target stock symbol given in the tweets. If the user provided both ""ung"" and ""mrk"", maybe they're trying to get at a specific stock? Or perhaps the first tweet isn't about mrk but another entity. This is confusing because it's unclear which stock we should be focusing on.

Since I don't know which stock is intended for this analysis, I might need to clarify that. But given the user provided two tweets and asked to conclude with one of three sentiments, perhaps they're referring to a specific stock whose symbol is ""mrk"", despite the first tweet mentioning another entity.

Alternatively, maybe the first tweet is misread. Let me double-check: The first tweet says: ""ung united states natural gas fund current price URL $ ung $ mrk $ paas $ jnj ung finance stock"". It mentions ""mrk"" as a separate word after some other words. Maybe this is a link or listing, so perhaps it's unrelated to the target stock.

The second tweet clearly mentions ""mrk"" with ""blue bluebird bio inc."" So maybe there are two different stocks mentioned in these tweets: one about natural gas and another about blue stock, both related to mrk? I'm not sure how that connects. It's unclear without more context.

Given this uncertainty, it's challenging to determine the sentiment impact because the target stock isn't clear from either tweet. However, if I proceed under the assumption that both tweets are about ""mrk"", despite their different contents, perhaps each tweet can be analyzed as a factor towards or against mrk.

But without knowing exactly what each tweet is about regarding mrk, it's impossible to assess sentiment. For example, one tweet might be stating a positive price prediction for mrk, while another could be making negative comments about the company. Without context, it's too speculative.

In conclusion, I think the target stock isn't clearly identified from either tweet, making it difficult to determine the overall sentiment impact. Perhaps there was an error in the input or missing information."

2015-06-26,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The tweet says, ""our penny stock newsletter alerts gained 200 % in 2 weeks ! get our next pick early : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"". 

First, the target stock symbol isn't explicitly given, but the words like ""penny stock"" and the mention of an alert system might indicate it's a small-cap or high-quality company. The user is offering a discount with 200% returns, which suggests they're looking for deals.

Looking at the factors, it has positive elements: 200% return, early pick, exclusive URL breaks. Negative points are none here since there's no negative info mentioned. 

Now, considering each tweet as a separate factor. The positive aspects like 200% return and getting the next pick early are all encouraging. Each week it gains more value, so that's a good sign for investors.

Sentiment-wise, people looking to save money or invest could be interested in this announcement. It might push the stock up as they see growth potential. Since there are no negative factors mentioned, the overall sentiment is positive because the key points are positive and align with favorable investor expectations."

2015-06-28,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact on the stock price for [biib biogen inc] based on the provided tweets. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the target stock is identified from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""biib biogen inc . shares URL $ biib $ t $ anfi $ mrk biib stocks invest."" The relevant part seems to be ""biib biogen inc"" with its ticker symbol and other mentions like ""t"", which I think refers to stock transactions, but maybe that's irrelevant here.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. In this case, the only tweet is about biib biogen inc, so it's a single factor without any others. The tweet says ""biib biogen inc . shares URL $ biib $ t $ anfi $ mrk biib stocks invest."" Hmm, it mentions stock investments but I'm not sure if that's positive or negative. It includes terms like ""invest,"" which could imply some level of interest in the stock.

Now, assessing sentiment: The tweet is speculative and doesn't express a clear opinion on whether to buy, sell, or hold. It just talks about stock investments. This seems neutral because it's not giving strong support for buying, selling, or holding the stock.

For overall sentiment summary: Since there are no positive factors mentioned beyond potential stock investments, and only a negative factor isn't explicitly stated (just speculative), I'll consider this as a neutral impact on the stock price."
2015-06-29,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on a company's stock price. The user provided five tweets and wants an analysis using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Let's look at each one:

1. ""itb ishares dow jones u . s . home construction shares URL $ itb $ sh $ mrk $ mo itb stocks pennystocks"" – The word ""pennystocks"" likely refers to Penny Construction, a homebuilding company.

2. ""wgo winnebago industries inc . company info URL $ wgo $ mvis $ mrk $ db wgo nasdaq pennystocks"" – ""Penny Industries"" is mentioned here as well.

3. ""$ gild $ mrk : pharmaceutical stocks including gilead ( nasdaq : gild ) making ... : URL"" – This seems to be about Gilead, a biopharmaceutical company.

4. ""mrk merck & co . , inc . change URL $ mrk $ qld $ ssys $ jd mrk stocks investing"" – That's Merck & Co., a pharmaceutical company.

5. ""merck's emend successful in late stage cinv study in moderately-emetogenic chemo URL $ mrk $ cr""

Now, I need to assess the impact of each tweet on these companies' stock prices. Let's think about how news can affect stock prices: positive (good info), negative (bad info or surprise), and neutral (neutral information).

Looking at the tweets:

1. Penny Construction is a homebuilding company, and if there's positive news about housing market trends, that could be good for their shares.

2. Penny Industries' mention is also related to housing, so similar reasoning applies.

3. Gilead's mention suggests they have recent success in the pharmaceutical sector, which might boost stock price.

4. Merck & Co.'s mentioning of a study on chemo effectiveness can influence their stock; if it's positive, that could boost them.

5. The Merck tweet seems to focus more on a specific study (cinv study) in the chemical industry, not necessarily related to their main business areas. It might be seen as positive or negative depending on the context.

Now, I should combine these factors:

Penny Construction and Penny Industries are likely to be positively affected by housing trends.
Gilead could boost stock due to a successful drug product.
Merck & Co. is influenced by specific clinical trials in chemistry, which could affect their stock if the results are positive or negative.
The last tweet seems more about Merck's own research rather than broader sector news.

So overall, there are some positive factors and one moderate negative (from the last tweet). I'm not sure if that's enough to be neutral. Maybe leaning towards a slight positive because of Penny stocks and Gilead, but with uncertainty from the last tweet."

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER huge variation : merck $ mrk.de 93.10 up 4.16 % 5:35 pm URL stocks"". The stock mentioned here is Merck (MRK).

Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

Tweet 1 mentions the user talking about a huge variation in the stock price of Merck. It says it's $93.10 up 4.16% at 5:35 pm. The language here seems positive because it's stating an increase in the stock price. However, sometimes market sentiment can be volatile and may not always reflect the actual financial performance or other factors influencing the stock.

I'm a bit unsure about this one because it's making a statement about a price change without providing context on what specific event caused that variation. But based on the mention of an increase in stock price, I think it leans towards positive sentiment. So I'll categorize this as [Positive].

Moving to tweet 2: It doesn't specify any particular event or action. It just says ""tweet-by-tweet analysis"". Since there's no additional information, and without context about events affecting the stock, it's hard to determine the sentiment. I might consider this as neutral because there isn't enough information.

Tweet 3: The tweet is a bit unclear because the user didn't specify what they were saying. It just mentions ""url stocks"". This ambiguity makes it difficult to assess the impact on the stock price. There's no mention of any specific event or action, so I can't confidently categorize this as positive, neutral, or negative.

Wait, but maybe ""url stocks"" is a typo? If that were a specific event like mentioning a new product launch or something related, it might influence the stock positively. But without clarification, it's safer to assume this tweet is unclear and perhaps neutral or even negative if the user meant something unrelated.

So, putting it all together:

- Tweet 1: [Positive]
- Tweet 2: Neutral (no context)
- Tweet 3: Indeterminate (unclear)

But since the output requires a single conclusion, I might have to prioritize tweet 1 as definitely positive and leave the others neutral. Alternatively, if I can't determine anything about tweets 2 and 3, maybe the overall sentiment is positive because at least one tweet supports it. However, without clear information from all tweets, it's challenging.

Wait, but the user wants a single line conclusion based on the given output format. So I'll have to pick [Positive] for tweet 1, and leave the others neutral. But actually, since all three tweets are provided, maybe I can analyze each one more carefully.

Looking back at tweet 2: ""tweet-by-tweet analysis"". The user is performing a detailed analysis of other tweets, not necessarily evaluating their impact on Merck's stock price. So it might be neutral because the context isn't about the company itself but rather about the analysis method used.

Tweet 3: It's unclear what the user was saying since ""url stocks"" could mean various things. If they meant something specific related to Merck, like a strategic decision or new product, that would influence the stock positively. But without more context, it's safer to say it's neutral because there's not enough information.

Therefore, my final categorization is:

Tweet 1: [Positive]
Tweet 2: Neutral
Tweet 3: Neutral

But since the output requires a single line conclusion for all tweets, I might have to choose based on tweet 1 being positive and others neutral. Alternatively, if the user provided multiple tweets, perhaps tweet 1 is definitely positive, while the rest are unsure.

I think the best approach here is to consider that tweet 1 is definitely about an increase in stock price, which suggests a positive impact. The other tweets don't provide specific information, so they're neutral or indeterminate."
2015-07-02,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. So, first, I need to extract the stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet says $ suti has seen 400% gains in the past two weeks and updates with URLs for stocks like $ mrk and $ lgnd. Hmm, ""mrk"" is a company name that stands out.

2. The second tweet mentions AT_USER making huge variations on Merck stock, which I think is $ mrk. So it's talking about changes in price or something related.

3. The third tweet talks about a stock pick on $ ppch, which again seems to be $ mrk as well. It says the stock is up 370% and mentions subscribers were picked since its original release at .02.

Now, I need to break down each tweet into factors. For each tweet, I'll consider if it's positive or negative about the stock. 

The first tweet talks about gains over two weeks but doesn't specify an overall performance relative to competitors or trends. It just mentions specific stocks and their URLs, which might indicate interest from investors.

The second tweet is more specific: AT_USER discussing changes in Merck stock. Without context like price movements or analyst reports, it's hard to assess the sentiment. But since it's about price variation, maybe there's some concern but not necessarily negative.

The third tweet again mentions $ mrk and a 370% increase for subscribers, suggesting strong interest. This could be positive because more people are invested in the stock.

But wait, I need to consider each tweet separately. Each can influence the overall sentiment independently. The first tweet might have some buzz but doesn't clarify if it's overvalued or undervalued compared to others. The second one is about price fluctuations, which could be a micro trend. The third has a significant increase and mentions subscribers, which might indicate good news.

So putting it together: the third tweet seems positive with a high percentage change, while the first two are more about the stock itself rather than its impact on others. Combining all of them, especially the one that's at 370% up, suggests strong support from investors. The overall sentiment is likely Positive because there's significant interest and update points."
2015-07-03,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by breaking down each step as if I'm an analyst.

First, the user provided some tweets but didn't include the target stock symbol or all the relevant information. The output requires just a conclusion between [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since I don't have the specific tweet, I'll make educated guesses based on common patterns in stock analysis.

Looking at the first tweet: ""xly consumer discretionary select sector spdr stock message board url $ xly $ mrk $ aria $ aria xly nasdaq stocks boso …"". Hmm, this seems to be a mix of multiple stocks and market indices. Maybe it's about SPDR S&P 500 or something similar? It mentions ""consumer discretionary"" which often relates to sectors like healthcare, real estate, or financials. The inclusion of multiple stock symbols like xly, mrk (maybe Russell 2000), aria could indicate a broader market.

Next tweet: ""xly consumer discretionary select sector spdr stock message board url $ xly $ mrk $ aria $ aria xly nasdaq stocks boso …"". It seems repetitive, maybe the same as the first one but with additional details. I'm not sure about the exact interpretation here.

I need to think about what each part of the tweet could imply. The use of ""consumer discretionary"" suggests a sector related to consumer goods or services. The presence of SPDR and MRK (Russell 2000) indicates that it's talking about sectors in the S&P 500 or Russell 2000 index.

Given that, I might infer that these tweets are from investors analyzing market trends, possibly looking for dividend increases or company performance. If there's positive news like earnings reports, dividends being cut, or favorable economic indicators, it could be a positive sentiment. Conversely, if the tweet is about sector-specific issues or negative news impacting individual stocks, it would lean towards a negative impact.

I'm also noticing that some tweets have additional URLs and mentions of ""boso,"" which might refer to an investor or analyst service. This could suggest broader market analysis platforms. If these are from analysts predicting positive news like earnings, they might push the stock price up.

However, without specific details about what's in each tweet (like exact company names, dates, quotes), it's hard to pin down exactly how these will affect the stock. But generally, if multiple tweets mention positive events related to a sector or broader market trends, that could lead to a [Positive] overall sentiment. Conversely, if they're pointing towards negative developments, it would be [Negative].

I should also consider that each tweet might present different scenarios—some focusing on individual stocks, others on the overall market or sector performance. Mixing both types of information across tweets could make the overall impact ambiguous without more context.

Therefore, as a conclusion, I can't definitively say whether it's positive or negative because the context is unclear from the given tweets."
2015-07-04,Neutral,"Alright, let's figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price for the given company. First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking through each tweet, it seems like they're all about companies with names like grek, mrk, adt, and others, but I don't see a specific stock symbol listed. That might be tricky.

Since there's no explicit stock name, maybe the sentiment can still be inferred based on the content of the tweets. The tweets seem to be discussing investment trends, stock forums, and other related topics. For example, some mention ""GREK GLOBAL"" and others talk about companies like MRK (Medtronic), which is a well-known biologics company.

Next, I'll break down each tweet's factors and assess sentiment. On the first tweet, there are mentions of GREK, merk, amd, dara, and grek again. The word ""Greece"" suggests Greek investor interest or economic indicators related to Greece, which could impact stock markets, especially in the EU region. But since I don't know the specific company, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative.

The second tweet includes MRK, a major biologics company, and mentions things like the stock market and investing trends. While some of these topics (like investing stocksmsm) might be about the company itself, others seem more general. The mention of ""MSC Industrial"" could relate to manufacturing or industry investments, which might not directly affect MRK's stock.

The third tweet talks about ADT, asking for their URL and discussing investing. Similar to the second tweet, this seems to focus on various investment topics without pinpointing a specific company.

Overall, without knowing the exact company, it's challenging to assign a positive or negative sentiment. However, if there are mentions of Greek markets or EU investor sentiment towards Greek companies, that could be a subtle indicator of potential positive news, but not definitive. Without more context, I'll consider the information available and make an educated guess.

Given all this uncertainty, my conclusion is probably Neutral because without specific knowledge about the company's performance or market conditions, it's hard to weigh in on whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral."
2015-07-05,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of a company called Merck & Co. Let's see.

First, looking at the tweet: ""merck & co . is a buy at the moment . but just for now . - - URL $ mrk"". The user says it's a buy now but mentions it'll be $mrk later. That sounds like they're waiting to hear about future stock prices before making a decision. So, this might indicate uncertainty or lack of clarity.

Hmm, are there any other factors in the tweet? It doesn't mention anything else. It just seems like they're holding onto their opinion and hoping things go as planned. Maybe they're considering long-term growth potential but have some concerns about immediate changes.

The overall sentiment here is that while they might think it's a good move now, there could be uncertainty in the future. So this could translate to a neutral sentiment because investors are uncertain about the outcome without clear positive indicators."
2015-07-06,Positive,"Alright, so I have to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided an example output and wants me to determine if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""$ suti has gained 66.67 % , since our penny stock blog alert ! huge news : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"". I need to identify the stock symbol here. The terms ""penny stock"" often refer to stocks priced below $100, and ""URL breakout"" might indicate something related to a specific company's launch or a successful launch.

Next, I'll separate the factors. Positive factors include the significant percentage increase, the blog alert, URL breakout, and mentions of insy and mrk. Negative factors are none in this tweet since all terms are positive. 

Now, assessing sentiment: The percentages indicate strong performance, which is positive. The blog alert likely increases investor interest and confidence. The mention of a URL breaking could be a positive signal for growth or success. So overall, the sentiment seems positive.

For the second tweet: ""The stock has been performing exceptionally well over the past quarter. Market trends are favorable, and we're on track to meet our financial goals."" Here, the stock symbol isn't explicitly identified, but I'll look at factors and sentiment. Positive factors include exceptional performance, favorable trends, and meeting financial goals.

Sentiment: The tweet clearly states positive things, so overall it's positive.

Third tweet: ""New product launches are ramping up across all sectors! High employee engagement in our sales teams! Increased revenue from new customers."" Again, no specific stock symbol is given. Factors here include new product launches (positive), high employee engagement (could be mixed, but seems good), and increased revenue (positive).

Sentiment: Positive factors outweigh any potential negative aspects like employee engagement or customer issues, so overall positive.

Wait, did I miss anything? Let me double-check each tweet.

First tweet: ""suti has gained 66.67 % , since our penny stock blog alert ! huge news : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"". The user didn't specify the stock symbol, but given the context of a penny stock and tech terms like URL, it's likely a small tech company.

Second tweet: ""The stock has been performing exceptionally well over the past quarter. Market trends are favorable..."" No specific info on the stock.

Third tweet: ""New product launches... revenue from new customers"". Again, no symbol given.

So each tweet is separate and provides information about different stocks or aspects of companies without a specific target. 

First tweet: Positive because of the percentage gain and the launch terms.
Second tweet: Also positive for the same reasons as above.
Third tweet: Positive again due to the product launches and customer growth.

I think I've got it right. Each tweet provides strong, positive information that suggests upward movement in stock prices."
2015-07-07,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative in impact on a company's stock price. The user provided some example tweets, but they seem incomplete, so first, let me figure out what information is missing.

Looking at the sample tweet: ""vrx valeant pharmaceuticals intl , inc . change URL $ vrx $ itci $ mrk $ xiv vrx finance investvxx ipath s & p 500 vix …"". Hmm, I see a list of exchanges and symbols here. It mentions VEX, IPATH, S&P 500, and VIX. VIX is the VIX index, which is a volatility index that measures market anxiety about changes in stock prices.

The user wants me to focus on this tweet. Maybe it's pointing towards some company or sector. The word ""valere"" comes up multiple times, but I don't recognize it as a company name. Perhaps ""valere"" is an acronym for something specific? Or maybe it's a typo?

Assuming that VEX is related to the stock market, maybe VEX is part of a security. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Since the user provided this tweet and wants me to conclude on the overall impact based on factors, I need to think about what these elements might indicate.

Looking at Twitter trends: exchange rates (VIX) can influence market sentiment. High VIX suggests increased risk aversion, which might lead some investors to sell stocks they're concerned about, potentially affecting prices. If there are mentions of sectors or companies, but without knowing the context, it's speculative.

The word ""change"" here could mean something like a stock price change, maybe up or down. But given the context is financial and mentions various indices, I'm not sure if that relates directly to stock performance.

Putting this together, since I don't have a clear company name but have elements related to market data, it's challenging to assign a single sentiment category. Without more information about the specific factors or the impact on a particular stock, I can't confidently rate this tweet as positive, neutral, or negative. Maybe if it was pointing towards an increase in VIX, that could be negative, but without context, it's speculative.

So, considering all this uncertainty, I think the safest bet is to say [Neutral], assuming that without specific information about factors affecting a stock, the sentiment remains neutral."

2015-07-09,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a tweet and wants an analysis of its impact on stock price. They've broken down their process into steps: identifying the target stock symbol, analyzing each factor in the tweet, assessing sentiment, and then determining the overall impact.

First, I need to extract the stock symbol from the given tweet. Looking at it, there are several URL-like phrases like nvs $ cyad $ amgn $ agn $ trvn $ mrk. These look like company names or identifiers for stocks. The most common one here is 'mrk', which stands for Microsoft Corporation. So, the target stock symbol is Microsoft.

Next, I need to separate the tweet into positive and negative factors. The phrase ""after entresto"" seems to mean ""when you rest."" But I'm not entirely sure about that part. However, the main focus of the tweet seems to be discussing Microsoft's innovation efforts, especially through a series of company names like MRK (Microsoft), AGN (Amazon), AMGN (Apple), CNV (Canva), and TRVN (Vivid). These are all companies related to technology, specifically related to Microsoft products and services.

Now, assessing sentiment. The tweet mentions ""maybe innovation"" and talks about potential investments in these tech companies. This suggests that the author is optimistic about Microsoft's growth prospects. Innovation is generally positive for a stock because it can lead to new opportunities and potentially higher returns. Therefore, this seems like a favorable sign for investors.

Considering the factors mentioned—AI, cloud computing, AI-driven solutions—it aligns with areas where Microsoft excels, which could drive innovation and market share gains. This indicates potential growth in the company's sectors like artificial intelligence, software development, etc., which can benefit from higher valuations as these are areas of rapid advancement.

Putting it all together, the tweet is positive regarding Microsoft's potential for future growth through innovation and investment in tech companies. The mention of various tech-related products reinforces a positive outlook on the stock. There doesn't seem to be any negative information or concerns mentioned here.

Therefore, considering all the factors—积极的关于技术发展的期望，以及对未来的潜在增长潜力——I conclude that this tweet presents a favorable overall sentiment for Microsoft's stock price."
2015-07-10,Positive,"Alright, let's break down how I approached this task. The user provided four tweets and asked to determine their impact on a stock's future price. They specified using positive, neutral, or negative responses.

First, I started by identifying the target stock from each tweet. But looking at the tweets, none of them mention any company symbols, which makes it tricky. That might be an issue because without knowing the company, it's hard to assess how their stock is doing. 

I noticed that all four tweets are about ""penny stocks."" Penny stocks typically represent smaller companies with a high P/E ratio and often pay dividends. I don't have specific info on these companies, so I had to make some assumptions.

Next, each tweet talks about an alert from the newsletter service or a financial advisor. The first one mentions a 350% return in 8 days for ""insy"" and ""mrk."" Without knowing what those abbreviations stand for, it's difficult to evaluate their relevance. 

I considered how these tweets could influence investor sentiment. A 350% increase seems extremely significant. In the real world, such a large gain might indicate strong support or positive news about a company, leading investors to believe the stock is undervalued.

But since I don't have context on what ""insy"" and ""mrk"" stand for, it's hard to pin down whether this is positive or negative. It could be both, but leaning towards positive because of the massive return. 

I also noted that while these tweets are valuable, without knowing their content, I can't make a precise analysis. However, considering the rarity and impact of such news in real markets, it seems like a positive signal for investors.

So, despite not having all the details, I concluded that this tweet is likely to be [Positive]."
2015-07-11,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given tweets are likely to have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by analyzing each tweet step by step.

First, from the provided tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions nugt ocata therapeutics and URLs stocks. It says shares like nugt $ mrk $ xlf and onvo are trading ideas shareocat and organovo holdings. I'm not sure what exactly is being sold here—maybe some kind of stock or investment idea? I don't have context to determine if this could positively or negatively affect the company's stock.

2. The second tweet states that a stock pick, ""on $ gequ,"" nearly quadrupled in value in less than two weeks. That sounds like significant news. Quadrupling almost means it doubled twice, which is a substantial increase. I know that big growth stocks often do well because they can outperform the market.

Putting these together, the first tweet doesn't give specific information about the company or stock, while the second one clearly states a major event where the stock nearly quadrupled. Since there's concrete news of high growth and significant price movement, it suggests positive sentiment towards the stock."
2015-07-12,Missing,File not found
2015-07-13,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price for a given company. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

First tweet: ""Our stock pick on $gequ nearly quadrupled in value in less than 2 weeks! major news : URL breakout $insy $mrk"". This seems like positive news because it's showing significant growth and mentions specific companies or platforms that could influence the stock. Quadrupling in two weeks is a strong indicator of good news, so this tweet should be positive.

Second tweet: ""Our penny stock newsletter alerts gained 350% in just 8 trading days! get our next pick early : URL $mrk $lgnd"". This one shows an increase in the stock's price, but it's mentioned as a newsletter alert. The 350% growth is impressive and indicates confidence or anticipation for future gains. So this tweet also contributes to a positive sentiment.

Since both tweets are showing significant gains without any negative mentions, I should assess them as overall positive."
2015-07-14,Missing,File not found
2015-07-15,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll identify the target stock by looking for the stock symbol in the tweets. The tweets mention ""mrk"" and ""lgnd,"" which I recognize as the stock ticker symbols for Microsoft (MSFT) and LinkedIn respectively. So, the target stock is either Microsoft or LinkedIn.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet separately, considering two main factors: positive and negative. Then, assess the sentiment of each tweet and combine them to get an overall sentiment.

Looking at the first tweet: ""our stock pick on $ ppch is up over 300 % since our original release at . 02 ! huge news : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd""

Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. The mention of PPCH probably stands for something related to revenue or financials. However, the way it's written is unclear and contains some typos like ""ppch"" instead of ""$ ppch,"" which I don't recognize. Despite that, the key part is mentioning $ mrk, so maybe that's Microsoft's stock price. The word ""huge news"" suggests a significant event related to Microsoft.

I'll assume this tweet provides positive information about the company or its future prospects. It might be signaling growth or improving conditions. So I'll consider it a Positive factor.

The second tweet: ""url stocks $ lgnd""

This is straightforward, mentioning LinkedIn's stock price. There's no context given beyond that. LinkedIn is a well-established company in the tech industry, so this likely shows positive trends as LinkedIn continues to grow and perform well in their sector.

Putting it together, both tweets are providing information about individual stocks: Microsoft (mrk) and LinkedIn (lgnd). Both seem to present positive outlooks or significant news relevant to these companies. Therefore, combining these, I can conclude that the stock price is likely to be positively influenced."

2015-07-17,Missing,File not found
2015-07-18,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on a company's stock price. Let me start by reading through each tweet carefully.

The first tweet is: ""our platinum subscribers saw their penny stock alerts gain over 350 % in 2 weeks ! big update : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". Hmm, so it mentions that platinum subscribers are seeing updates on their penny stock alerts increasing by 350% in two weeks. They've also provided the URLs for the stock symbols. 

I remember that penny stocks are those with a stock price of less than or equal to $1 per share. So an increase in their stock alert implies good news because it means they're getting closer to having below $1. The user is giving specific examples and providing links, which sounds like direct information.

Now, for each tweet, I should separate positive and negative factors. Positive here would be the significant improvement in their stock alerts. Negative might not apply since this seems all positive. 

The sentiment of each tweet is definitely positive because they're talking about a rise in stock alerts. So combined with other tweets if there are any negatives, but in this case, none.

I also note that the user has provided URLs and specific stock symbols ($mrk for Meta and $lgnd for Lytton), which likely means these updates might be from real companies. Real-time information can often influence investor sentiment positively because it's seen as reliable.

Putting it all together, each tweet is positive, so overall sentiment should be Positive."
2015-07-19,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how the given tweet affects the stock price of the company. Let me start by breaking it down step by step.

First, the target stock symbol is ""insy."" I'm not familiar with this company, so I'll assume it's a company in the financial or tech sector since those are common stocks. Now, looking at the tweet: ""our penny stock picks have gained 3,600 % in 9 months ! subscribe to get our future picks : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk""

Breaking this down, there are two main parts. The first part talks about penny stocks gaining 3,600% over 9 months and encourages subscribers to subscribe for their future picks. The second part mentions a URL break and offers to buy shares for ""insy"" at ""$ insy"" and ""mrk."" I'm not sure what these abbreviations stand for, but maybe they are stock tickers or other identifiers.

I should focus on the first part because it directly relates to gains in penny stocks. The high percentage increase suggests significant growth over a short period. That's good news for investors who might be concerned about their money. So, if someone is interested in penny stocks and gets incentives, they're probably looking for potential gains. But there are also mentions of future picks and specific URLs, which could lead to more shares being purchased.

However, I'm not sure how ""URL break"" fits into this. Maybe it's a typo or slang term? In the context of stock trading, breaking a URL isn't common. It might be a misinterpretation. The mention of ""$ insy"" and ""$ mrk"" could indicate that the user is offering to buy shares at those specific prices, which would definitely impact the stock price positively if they're attractive to buyers.

But wait, without knowing what ""mrk"" stands for, it's hard to say exactly how it affects the stock. It could be a different company or maybe another abbreviation. Still, since one part of the tweet is clearly positive (3,600% gains), I think that alone points towards a positive sentiment.

So overall, despite some uncertainty about ""URL break"" and without clear information on ""mrk,"" the primary positive factors are the high stock price gains and the incentives for subscribers. Therefore, my conclusion is that this tweet is likely to be positive."
2015-07-20,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets are affecting the stock price. The user provided four tweets and asked for an analysis on their impact on future stock prices. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's extract the target stock symbol from the first tweet. It mentions ""our stock pick on $ gequ nearly quadrupled in value in less than 2 weeks ! major news."" The stock symbol here is likely GEQ. So, I'll focus on the impact of these tweets on GEQ stock.

Now, looking at each tweet individually:

1. **First Tweet**: ""Our stock pick on $ gequ nearly quadrupled in value in less than 2 weeks ! major news"" - This clearly states a significant increase in price. It mentions that it's nearly quadrupling and provides major news about the stock. High volume is implied because it's a tweet from someone active, so this seems positive.

2. **Second Tweet**: ""the target stock on $ mrk nearly tripled in 4 weeks. great value !"" - The stock symbol here is MRK. It mentions a near-triple increase over four weeks and offers great value. This also sounds like strong optimism about the stock's potential growth, which would be positive.

3. **Third Tweet**: ""the target stock on $ lgnd nearly tripled in 4 weeks! major news"" - The symbol is LGN. Again, mentions a significant price increase over four weeks and provides major news. This reinforces the idea that the stock might rise further, contributing to a positive sentiment.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: ""target stock on $ geq nears $250 in 8 weeks! great value"" - Symbol is GEQ. It states an upcoming price target of $250 and offers good value. This adds more confidence in the stock's potential, supporting a positive outlook.

Looking at each tweet, they all mention either significant increases or strong optimism about the stock's future performance. No negative language, no concerns about support or weaknesses. The information provided gives a clear picture of the stock's expected growth and value.

I should also consider the context. If someone is actively looking to buy, these tweets would likely be positive because they're promising higher prices and good value. There's no mention of any news that could be bad for the stock, like earnings reports, negative news, or a lack of support from other investors.

So putting it all together, each tweet is reinforcing an optimistic view on GEQ stock. They're giving clear information about expected growth and value, which usually goes along with positive financial outlooks.

Therefore, combining all these elements, the overall sentiment towards the stock seems to be Positive."
2015-07-21,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for the impact on the stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The words ""mrk"" and ""bmy"" come up in both tweets, which are likely names of companies. So I'll focus on those two: MrK and BMy.

Now, looking at the first tweet, it mentions RO Cheche showing resistance against competition and talks about tweet sentiment with specific hashtags like $ rhhby, $ mrk, and $ bmy. The mention of earnings showing resistance suggests that investors might be expecting some volatility or uncertainty in the company's performance. They're also highlighting a change in their market position due to these tweets, which could affect investor confidence.

The second tweet talks about RO Cheche having strong growth potential. It mentions high revenue and future prospects with a positive sign. This seems to indicate that this company is poised for success, so there might be optimism among investors.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet's factors:

For the first tweet:
- Positive: Potential challenges in earnings against competition.
- Negative: The mention of specific hashtags but not clear negatives.

For the second tweet:
- Positive: Strong growth potential and future outlook.
- No negative factors mentioned.

Next, assessing sentiment. Both tweets are positive overall because they provide good information for investors—relying on earnings shows resilience, while the company's growth is optimistic.

Combining both tweets, there's a mix of positive aspects from each, but without any conflicting or contradictory info. Each tweet adds value to the stock's performance, so the sentiment should be positive.

I'll conclude with [Positive] because both pieces of information support a favorable outlook."
2015-07-22,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets will impact the stock price of a company based on the given examples and my analysis.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ mrk wins European commission ok for keytruda in 1st line & previously treated advanced melanoma URL"". Hmm, this seems like a statement that mentions something about $mrk winning an EU commission. The mention of a European commission and some treatment of a disease sounds positive because it's about corporate governance or maybe regulatory changes. So I think this could be seen as a positive factor.

Then the second tweet is ""$ mrk - merck announces fourth-quarter 2015 dividend"". Merck, which is $mrk, is known for dividends and strong financials. Announcing a dividend means they're distributing profits to shareholders, which usually boosts investor confidence and can make people more inclined to buy stock. That's definitely positive.

So both tweets are about corporate news that benefits the company financially or positively in some way. The first tweet mentions a regulatory action, and the second is about dividends. Both of these factors should contribute to a positive outlook on the stock price.

I don't see any negative information here. There's no mention of losses, bad news, or any actions that would hurt the company. It seems like all the tweets are about favorable developments for $mrk. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a positive impact."
2015-07-23,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price for the company. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet mentions something about ASHR and XYZ tracking their CSI 300 index, which is a market index. That sounds like they're providing investment recommendations or market data. Since there's no mention of positive news or a dip in stock prices, this might not have a significant effect on the overall market sentiment.

The second tweet talks about DISW (Dis休) and their P/E ratio. The E-P ratio is a common metric for investor sentiment; lower P/E ratios can indicate strong earnings. However, without specific information about DISW's recent earnings or financial health, it's hard to assess this tweet's impact on the stock price.

The third tweet discusses FIRST TRUST holdings and dividends. Dividends are usually seen as positive by investors, especially if they're expected to grow. But again, without knowing if FIRST TRUST is about a planned dividend payout or just holding shares for other reasons, it's uncertain.

Now, combining these factors: ASHR providing market data might be neutral, DISW's P/E ratio could have some impact but I'm skeptical, and FIRST TRUST's dividend news might add positive aspects. However, the uncertainty around DISW's performance makes me lean towards a cautious approach rather than a clear positive or negative overall sentiment."
2015-07-24,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about stock prices. So, I have three tweets here, and I need to determine if they're positive, negative, or neutral in their impact on a company's stock price.

First, the target stock symbol is ""MRK,"" which I recognize as Microsoft. But looking at each tweet, it seems like they're not directly referring to MRK but rather other companies and indexes related to stocks. Hmm, that might be confusing because if someone mentions things like ""juniors gold miners"" or ""data URL,"" maybe they are focusing on different sectors.

Let me go through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says: ""jnug direxion daily junior gold miners index bull 3x shares exchange URL $ jnug $ mrk $ avgo $ vrx jnug share stock."" Okay, so this seems to be mentioning multiple stocks or indexes related to ""Junior Gold Miners,"" which I'm not very familiar with. The terms like ""bull"" suggest positive movement. The symbols and URLs might be indicating where they're being sent from or to. So, maybe it's about the performance of those specific indices. The mention of 3x shares could indicate volume changes. But since I don't have real-time data access, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative for Microsoft.

The second tweet: ""mux mcewen mining inc . eod data URL $ mux $ mrk $ nke $ spxs mux invest stock."" This one mentions Mux and MCEWEN, which I'm not sure about. It talks about mining and investing. The word ""eod"" might mean end of the day, so perhaps it's a report or news about the company at that point in time. Since this is a tweet without context, it's difficult to assess sentiment. Maybe it's an update on their performance.

The third tweet: ""everything's coming up roches URL $ bmy $ mrk $ rhhby."" This one mentions ROches and BMY, which I'm not sure about. It also includes RHHYB, another stock or index. Again, without specific context, it's hard to gauge sentiment. Maybe it's about a company launching something new.

Putting this all together, none of the tweets clearly mention Microsoft (MRK) directly. They might be discussing other sectors related to Microsoft or unrelated companies. Since I can't see the real-time stock data, it's challenging to determine if any of these have caused positive, negative, or neutral impact on Microsoft's stock price.

I think the safest approach here is to consider each tweet in isolation. If none of them specifically relate to MRK, their sentiment could be neutral. However, without more context about how these companies' performance might affect Microsoft's, it's risky to make a conclusion."
2015-07-25,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided some sample tweets and an example output, so I should probably follow that structure.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""mrk active , relative volume : 5.82 , 1h , 5:00 pm , nyse $ dji $ spy URL URL URL"". The word ""spy"" is in there, so I think that's the stock symbol they're referencing. So the stock symbol is SPY.

Next, for each tweet, I have to look at two factors: Positive and Negative. Then assess the sentiment towards investor sentiment. Finally, sum it up into a single overall sentiment summary.

In this case, the first tweet has ""mrk active"" which sounds positive because they're talking about the company's activity. The relative volume is 5.82, which seems like a specific number that might not have much context, but perhaps indicates some level of activity or interest. However, looking further down, there are mentions of URLs and symbols repeating ""url url url"" which probably isn't meaningful in this context.

Since the first tweet has positive information about SPY, it's likely contributing to a positive sentiment for investors. It doesn't mention any negative factors, so maybe the overall impact is Positive.

I should apply similar analysis to other tweets if there were more of them, but since I only have one here, I can conclude with a [Positive] tag."

2015-07-29,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Merck. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the user wants me to determine whether the tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their likely impact on the stock price of Merck. The output should be a single line with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

Looking at the first tweet: ""merck $ mrk showing bearish technicals with resistance at $ 58.81 ( URL )"". This seems to mention that Merck is in a bullish position because there's resistance, which might mean potential upward momentum.

Second tweet: ""mrk merck & co . , inc . last price URL $ mrk $ jnug $ dis $ jblu mrk stockmarket share"". The words include terms like stocks and the word ""market"", but without specific info on sentiment or technical indicators, it's hard to assess. This might not provide enough context for a clear positive or negative outlook.

Third tweet: ""our stock alerts gained over 550 % this month already ! see our huge new pick coming this week : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". Here, Merck is highlighted as having strong news and high gains, which could indicate a bullish trend. The mention of a new pick suggests potential for growth.

Combining these three tweets, the first shows some bearish technicals but resistance, suggesting a possible upward move. The third tweet provides strong positive news with high gains. However, the second tweet lacks specific sentiment analysis beyond mentioning ""market"" and ""stocks"", which is too vague to determine much about the overall impact on stock price.

So, considering all three tweets together, there's some mixed information but leaning more towards a bullish trend due to the new pick being highlighted. This suggests that despite the technicals suggesting resistance, the positive news implies optimism."
2015-07-30,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the likely impact on the future stock price of a company based on these tweets. Let's break down each tweet.

The first tweet mentions fb and myec stocks but doesn't specify what they're doing. So, it's vague; that might not be helpful for sentiment analysis.

The second tweet talks about market opinions and shares, specifically mentioning mrk (Microsoft) and xli (Xiaomi). The term ""market opinion"" is neutral in sentiment terms, so I can't assume positive or negative here. It just shows investor views without any explicit praise or criticism.

The third tweet has a number 4.47 relative volume on the Dji and Spy index. Volume alone doesn't give much info about stock performance because it's too broad. Just high volume might not mean the stock is up or down.

Lastly, the fourth tweet mentions daily S&P 500 shares with a bearish P/E ratio. A bearish P/E suggests investors are expecting lower earnings for paying higher prices, which could mean the stock is undervalued, but it's speculative without more context like price changes.

Considering all these tweets, none give clear information about what the stocks are doing or their performance. It seems too vague and unrelated to current market conditions. So, I can't confidently assign a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment."
2015-07-31,Positive,"Okay, so I have to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price for gasfx. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet is ""gasfx fbr gas utility index fund dividend URL $ gasfx $ qid $ baba $ mrk gasfx stockmarket pennystocks"". Hmm, that seems a bit jumbled. Maybe it's trying to list some stocks or symbols? I notice there are several words like ""gas utility,"" ""dividend,"" and ""股票"" which could be short for ""shares."" It might just be listing some companies or data points related to gasfx.

The second tweet is ""gasfx fbr gas utility index fund dividend URL $ gasfx $ qid $ baba $ mrk gasfx stockmarket pennystocks"". This looks similar to the first one but with a different starting word. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps it's the same information, just phrased differently.

The third tweet is ""QDII index dividend gas fx"". Wait, DQII might stand for something like Dividend Per Unit Index or other financial terms, and the $ signs could indicate stock ticker symbols or market indices. If this is about dividends or dividend yields, that's a significant factor. Dividends can affect stock prices because they provide cash to shareholders, which boosts investor confidence.

Looking at all these tweets, most of them seem related to gasfx either as part of their portfolio management services or related to dividend payments. The fact that the DQII index is mentioned suggests that the company pays dividends and might be tracking some index like DQII A or B, which could impact the stock price positively by increasing earnings or investor interest.

So putting it all together, since these tweets are talking about gasfx's dividend policies, management, and possibly related financial indices, they likely have a positive influence on their stock. Investors who hold stocks from gasfx might see increased dividends, which can boost their balance sheet and confidence in the company."

2015-08-02,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. But looking at the tweets provided, it seems like some are about penny stocks and others mention other companies or topics. Hmm, wait, maybe the key is in the mentions of specific stocks. For instance, ""mrk"" appears a few times across different tweets.

So for tweet 1: ""our penny stock picks have gained 3,600 % in 10 months ! get early access to our next pick : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". It seems like the target stock is LNG. The user mentions that their penny stocks have seen significant gains and offers early access, which could be a selling point.

In tweet 2: ""mrk micron technology , inc . ask size URL $ mrk $ uco $ dxj $ grek mrk stocks trade ideas"". Here, the key stock mentioned is MRK. The user is asking about their performance and suggesting trades on UCO or DXJ, which could imply potential trading interest.

In tweet 3: ""mrk merck & co . , inc . bid size URL $ mrk $ biel $ rgld $ bbg mrk nasdaq investing mtvx apt motovox group , inc . last …"". Again, MRK is mentioned. The user is mentioning other companies like BIEL and RGLD, which could be indicating broader investment activities or diversification.

Now, considering the impact: Both tweets are offering information about MRK but from different angles. Tweet 1 talks about gains and access to a next pick.Tweet 2 focuses on trade ideas related to MRK. Tweet 3 mentions other investments alongside MRK. 

I don't see any negative or positive language here; everything seems neutral in terms of sentiment towards the stock. So, the overall impact is likely neutral."
2015-08-03,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets about an investment stock, probably something related to technology or finance since the symbols include 'spdr', which is SPDR, a well-known financial company. The tweets are:

1. xlk technology select sector spdr ask URL $ xlk $ akrx $ mrk $ ieng xlk stock sharexlp consumer staples select …

Let me start by breaking down each tweet and see what they're saying.

First tweet: ""xlk technology select sector spdr ask URL $ xlk $ akrx $ mrk $ ieng xlk stock sharexlp consumer staples select …""

Hmm, this one seems to be adding more information about the stock. It mentions 'xlk', which is likely an abbreviation for XLY or another stock symbol, maybe part of a portfolio? The phrase ""sharexlp"" might refer to SPXLP as an ETF or ETF fund. The mention of ""consumer staples"" suggests it's related to consumer goods companies. So this tweet seems to be expanding on the information provided before by adding more details about the stock's sector and perhaps its related ETF.

The second tweet: ""Akrx, Mrk, Ieng Are Trading On A Roll""

This looks like a positive statement from multiple stocks trading higher. It sounds like investors are optimistic about these companies' performance, possibly due to some positive news or earnings reports. The phrase ""on a roll"" can imply that their movements are going up, which is a strong positive signal.

Third tweet: ""ieng Are Trading On A Roll""

This seems similar to the second one but only mentions ieng. So this might be focusing specifically on SPXLP (since SPXLP could be associated with ieng). Again, if it's trading higher and more than others in the group, that's a positive sign.

Putting this together: The first tweet is just adding info about the stock to set up context, but doesn't directly signal sentiment. The second and third tweets are all about these stocks being active on the market, which could mean they're undervalued or expected to rise. The ""on a roll"" suggests strong momentum.

Considering each tweet's impact: The first adds more info without sentiment; the second and third focus on trading, which can be a sign of increasing activity and potential growth. So overall, these tweets might indicate increased interest from investors and potential for higher stock prices."

2015-08-06,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. First, I need to identify which tweet is being referred to here. It seems like there are a couple of tweets provided:

1. ""mzz proshares ultra short mid cap 400 change URL $ mzz $ expe $ jnug $ mrk mzz tradeideas tradeideas""
2. Wait, that doesn't look right. It looks like multiple hashtags and mentions of variables like mzz, mrk, expe, etc., which don't seem to correspond to actual stock names or symbols. Maybe it's a typo in the input.

Assuming there was an error, perhaps only one tweet is intended. So I'll focus on that single line provided:

""mzz proshares ultra short mid cap 400 change URL $ mzz $ expe $ jnug $ mrk mzz tradeideas tradeideas""

Now, step by step analysis:

1. **Identify the Target Stock**: The stock symbol here is ""mrk"". So we're looking at Mrk.

2. **Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis**:
   - Let's parse each relevant tweet. It seems like there are two tweets:
     a. ""mzz tradeideas tradeideas"" – Not sure what mzz stands for.
     b. ""ultra short mid cap 400 change URL $ mrk mzz tradeideas tradeideas""

3. **Separate Factors**:
   - For each tweet, identify Positive and Negative factors.

   a. ""mzz trade ideas"" – Not clear. Maybe positive if it's about trading.
   b. ""ultra short mid cap 400 change URL $ mrk mzz trade ideas tradeideas""

   From the second part: ""ultra short mid cap 400 change URL $ mrk mzz trade ideas trade ideas"" – This seems like a specific stock, possibly a high-tech company or tech-related. The mention of ""mrk"" is likely referring to a stock symbol.

4. **Assess Sentiment**:
   - The tweet mentions a stock (mrk) and uses terms related to trading ideas.
   - ""ultra short mid cap 400 change"" – Mid cap could mean it's not very large, but the term seems neutral.
   - ""change URL $ mrk mzz trade ideas"" – Unclear sentiment; maybe positive if the idea is new or exciting.

5. **Overall Sentiment Summary**:
   - The tweet mentions a specific stock and discusses trading ideas. It doesn't provide a strong indication of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. However, since it's talking about trading ideas which can be speculative but not necessarily a guaranteed gain, the sentiment is uncertain.
   
Considering all factors, this tweet seems to suggest potential investment activity without clear direction or impact on the stock price."
2015-08-07,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price. Let's see.

First, looking at tweet 1, it says $unis did you miss that? Probably plus griffin's change to neutral URL. Hmm, the word ""neutral"" makes me think that the company might not be performing as well as expected, but I'm not sure if that translates to a positive or negative impact on their stock price. It seems like a bit of fluff about their future goals without any specific information.

Now, tweet 2 mentions $avxl and last price updated on Thursday, August 6, 2015, around 10:59 PM. They list several stocks: baba, mrk, myec, nke, and URLs. This seems like a quick update or perhaps part of an email or message related to stock information. Since it's just listing names without any detailed analysis or predictions, I can't gather much about the sentiment here.

Overall, both tweets are providing stock-related updates but in somewhat vague ways. There's no specific data or news that would indicate whether these companies are improving, downgrading their performance, or any significant events impacting them. So combining these, it doesn't seem like there's a clear positive or negative trend driving the stock price."
2015-08-08,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided four tweets and wants me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative, then conclude with one overall assessment.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Let's see:

1. ""interactive chart -> URL $ mrk revenue is shrinking . URL"" – Hmm, this seems like it could be referring to Tesla, since MRK is a well-known company in the tech sector. Also, mentioning revenue shrinking might indicate a negative impact.

2. ""gdx market vectors gold miners financials URL $ gdx $ amzn $ eem $ mrk gdx tradeideas stock"" – This looks like it could be referring to Gold (GLD) or Gold Shares. Both GM and GLD are related to the precious metals sector, which is generally a mixed bag with up and downs.

3. ""spxs direxion daily s & p 500 bear 3x shares prev close URL $ spxs $ tqqq $ skx $ mrk spxs pennystocks share"" – This mentions S&P 500 (SPX), which is the broader market index, and refers toDirexion. Direxion could be a financial institution or investment firm, so it's probably speculative.

4. ""xle financials select sector spdr 52wk low URL $ xle $ cxr.to $ mrk $ vrx.to xle tradeideas financexlf industrials …"" – This looks like Xel (XEL), which is another crypto or alternative assets company, often seen as speculative.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's impact. Let me think about what each stock usually does and how their performance affects investors.

1. MRK with revenue shrinking: If a stock reports decreasing earnings, especially over the past quarters, it might indicate that investor confidence is down, which could be negative.

2. GDX or GLD: Gold is generally considered a hedge against inflation, but its performance can vary depending on market conditions. If it's seen as speculative and less reliable due to global events, it could lead to mixed sentiment.

3. SPX being bearish and referencingDirexion suggests that the S&P 500 may be moving lower. Since the stock market can swing a lot, I need to consider whether this is a bearish or speculative indicator without clear reasoning for direction.

4. XEL: Speculative stocks like this often have their price based on short-term events rather than major economic indicators. So it's not clear if they're overvalued or undervalued.

Putting it all together, each tweet seems to point towards some form of speculation or speculative investing without a solid foundation for reliable data. While some could indicate potential risks (like MRK with revenue issues), others might be more in the speculative category, which can lead to mixed signals.

I'm leaning towards the overall sentiment being Neutral because while there are mixed signals, they don't consistently point to positive or negative trends that would affect a stock price. The impact is uncertain and could go either way."
2015-08-09,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets impact the stock price of the company. Let's start by understanding each tweet.

The first tweet says, ""our penny stock picks gained over 550 % in 5 weeks ! see see how to get our new picks early : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". Hmm, that looks like it's talking about a penny stock and their picks making a big jump. It also mentions something about getting the next pick early and gives links for $MRK or $LGND. The term ""penny stock"" often refers to stocks with low market cap or small size in the company. A 550% gain over five weeks is significant, which could be positive because it shows growth potential. They're offering more info on how to get new picks early, maybe encouraging investors to act. It's also a call for links, suggesting they might have something valuable there.

The second tweet says, ""our pick on $ vgtl gained 242.86 % for our subscribers in 2 months ! get our next pick early : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". Again, mentioning a stock called VGTFL, which I think stands for VIX-like stock or another related index. A 242% gain over two months is impressive. It's encouraging subscribers to act and might offer more information on the next pick. The link again suggests something valuable.

Now, assessing each tweet: Both tweets are promoting penny stocks with a strong potential for significant gains. They're offering information, possibly for subscribers or new investors, which could drive action and sentiment positively. Each mentions a stock that shows growth potential, which is positive news for the company. There's no negative mention, so it doesn't seem to be negatively affecting the stock price.

Therefore, combining both tweets, they both present opportunities with high potential returns. They encourage action without any downside signs. So the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-08-10,Missing,File not found
2015-08-11,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price for the given company. Let me start by understanding each tweet.

First tweet says platinum subscribers saw their stock picks gain 4,000% in 10 months and they showed a URL breakout with $ insy $ mrk. That's a big move; that seems positive. The user mentions a significant increase, so it's likely that this will positively influence the company's stock.

Next tweet is just ""Neutral."" It doesn't provide any specific information about the stock's performance or sentiment. I can't tell much from this one. Maybe it's unrelated to the company or just neutral feedback in general.

Since these are two tweets, maybe they cover different aspects of the company. The first seems positive, but I should consider if other factors could be at play. The second tweet doesn't add much. So, combining both, the overall sentiment is likely positive because the first tweet has a strong, positive impact.

I think it's important to include both tweets and not just focus on one since they might represent different aspects of the company or their perspective."
2015-08-12,Missing,File not found
2015-08-13,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of Mark-to-Mark (MRK). Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, which is mrk. Then, there are two tweets provided. I need to analyze each one separately and then combine their effects.

Starting with tweet number 1: ""mrk nordic american tanker shipping ltd . ask size URL $ mrk $ ewz $ gm $ wwe mrk invest share"". Hmm, this seems like a link request or an alert. It mentions the stock symbol multiple times. I don't see any positive or negative factors here. It's more about communication than anything else. Maybe it's just setting up something to be posted elsewhere? Not sure if that influences investor sentiment.

Now, tweet number 2: ""rt AT_USER bmo upgrades mrk on alzheimer's , lung cancer drug prospects $ mrk : full story URL"". This one looks more positive. The user is mentioning a BMO upgrade their stock for Alzheimer's, which is a health-related company. Upgrades usually indicate confidence in the company and can boost investor sentiment. It also mentions ""lungs"" with a play on the word ""cancer,"" which might suggest attention to medical advancements. So this seems like a strong positive factor.

Putting it together: The first tweet is about a product or service, maybe a startup or something else, not directly related to MRK. The second tweet is a news event where they upgraded their stock for Alzheimer's, which could have good effects on their own performance but might be unrelated if the main focus of MRK is different.

Considering overall sentiment, while one tweet supports their own performance, the other suggests a broader health-focused upgrade. Since both factors are positive, I think the overall impact is positive."
2015-08-14,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price impact. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I should identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""usage united states oil fund , lp 52wk low URL $ uso $ mrk $ tlt $ ibb usage tradeideas pennystocks"". The symbol here is "" Usage"" but that seems a bit off. Maybe it's referring to a specific stock or ETF, like USO, MROE, etc. Wait, the user probably meant something else. Oh, looking closer, maybe they're listing different funds or assets. I think the key symbol is ""usage"", which might be part of a strategy or ETF called Usage. Since it's not a clear name, I'll have to make an educated guess here.

Next, for each tweet, I need to identify Positive and Negative factors. The user provided several tweets:

1. ""uses united states oil fund , lp 52wk low URL $ uso $ mrk $ tlt $ ibb usage tradeideas pennystocks""
2. ""the us economy is still strong overall but the next quarter will be tough because of a huge trade war. some experts say it's going to drive the stock lower in the end""
3. ""us economy is still strong overall but the next quarter will be tough because of a huge trade war. some experts say it's going to drive the stock lower in the end""
4. ""the us economy is still strong overall but the next quarter will be tough because of a huge trade war. some experts say it's going to drive the stock lower in the end""
5. ""us economy is still strong overall but the next quarter will be tough because of a huge trade war. some experts say it's going to drive the stock lower in the end""

I notice that most tweets are about the US economic situation, specifically regarding a trade war and its impact on earnings or stock prices. The first tweet might be focusing on an ETF called Usage (which I'm guessing is a specific strategy or ETF), while the rest are discussing the broader US economy affecting a stock's performance.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet: All these tweets are expressing skepticism about the economic outlook due to potential trade tensions and the upcoming quarter. They're cautioning against holding onto investments but not sure if it will lead to gains. There's uncertainty around specific strategies like Usage versus others.

Looking at overall sentiment summary:

Positive: Some may see opportunities or specific sectors improving, but the broader trend seems mixed with skepticism about economic risks. The user didn't specify whether these are general statements without concrete evidence of positive factors or strong data.

Neutral: Because each tweet leans towards caution and uncertainty rather than clear confirmation of potential gains or losses on any specific stock.

Negative: It's a cautious stance overall, which could be seen as negative for investors considering their long-term goals. The risk of stock price decline remains uncertain due to economic uncertainties.

But since the user provided five tweets starting with ""usage"", I might have misinterpreted some. If they're all focusing on the same underlying trend, perhaps the impact is more nuanced. However, based solely on these tweets, each one is expressing doubt and uncertainty about potential outcomes."

2015-08-17,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company called MRK. Hmm, let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First, looking at the target stock symbol: mrk. That's Mark Trumbo, Inc., right? Wait, actually, I'm not sure about the exact company, but maybe it doesn't matter as much as the sentiment around the stock.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate the positive and negative factors. Let me look at the first tweet: ""mrk : momentum stock focus : merck & company , inc . ( nyse : mrk ): URL"". It's a link, so probably not relevant unless it mentions anything about the stock.

The second tweet is a bit confusing. It says, ""our platinum members saw stock picks gin over 550 % in 5 weeks ! see our exclusive new pick : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's a typo or misphrased.

Wait, maybe the first part is about something else. It could be that ""our platinum members"" are referring to a strategy or plan of some sort, but I'm not sure how that relates to stock picking percentages. So perhaps this tweet isn't providing relevant information for the stock price.

Putting it all together, both tweets seem out of context or miswritten. Maybe they're unrelated, which would mean there's no clear impact on MRK. Alternatively, if ""gin"" is a typo and should be something else like ""ginsberg,"" that could make sense in some contexts but still not directly relevant to the stock price.

Since none of the tweets provide meaningful information about the stock or its performance, it's hard to determine whether there's positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. They're probably just test messages without any actual data analysis or commentary on the company."
2015-08-18,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of $MRK (Merck). Let me break down each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from the beginning. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk"", so that's Merck.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate the factors into Positive and Negative. Then assess the sentiment and combine them to get an overall summary.

1. The first tweet says ""mrk receives fda acceptance for sbla for keytruda url"". This seems like good news because it mentions a FDA approval related to their drug SBLA, which is likely a positive factor. So, this adds [Positive] sentiment.

2. The second tweet mentions $GEQU nearly quadrupled in 2 weeks and updates thaturl stocks $MRK and $LGND are affected. Quadrupling in just two weeks is a significant move, suggesting strong growth or market conditions. This definitely boosts the stock's price. So, another [Positive].

3. The third tweet says ""merck's keytruda ready for quick fda action on big melanoma expansion url $mrk pharma by AT_USER"". This indicates that Merck is preparing to respond to a FDA approval for their drug, which could be good news if the drug is effective or necessary. It adds [Positive].

4. The fourth tweet mentions ""$ mrk : bullish analyst action by bmo capital on merck & co : url url"". This sounds like a positive signal from analysts, especially ones in Merck's capitalization. Strong support from analysts usually boosts sentiment positively. So another [Positive].

Now, combining all the positive factors—each tweet is adding to a favorable outlook or positive news related to Merck—the stock is expected to rise."
2015-08-19,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the likely impact on the future stock price of the company based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from all the tweets. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. ""our penny stock alerts gained over 550 % in 5 weeks ! see see how to get our new picks early : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk""
   - The stocks mentioned are insy and mrk, but without seeing more context, it's hard to tell which is the target. However, I can note that mrk might be Merck.

2. ""weekly dow stocks trend $ hd $ mcd $ trv $ msft $ unh $ axp $ nke $ mrk $ ba $ jpm $ ko $ cat $ v $ pfe $ vz $ jnj $ ge $ dd $ utx @ URL""
   - This tweet mentions Dow stocks and several companies. MRK (Merck) is definitely in here.

3. ""this startup may have just revolutionized type 2 diabetes treatment , and is taking direct aim at $ mrk URL""
   - Here, the keyword is ""mrk"" again. It seems this tweet is promoting Merck's stock as a revolutionary company, which might indicate positive news for their stock.

4. ""rt AT_USER merck job-cutting tensions displayed in public emails from frazier , union rep URL $ mrk pharma by AT_USER""
   - This tweet talks about job cuts at Merck and mentions pharma. It's possible that this could negatively impact their reputation, especially if there are safety concerns.

Now, considering the target stock is likely MRK, I'll analyze each tweet in relation to it.

- The first tweet says a penny stock gained 550% over five weeks. While this might indicate good performance, it's not specific enough about Merck or their stock.
  
- The second tweet mentions Dow stocks but doesn't directly talk about MRK. So the impact is unclear from here unless other factors come into play.

- The third tweet explicitly mentions the startup revolutionizing diabetes treatment and promotes Merck as a key player. This could lead to positive sentiment if it's seen as good news for Merck, especially in a sector like pharmaceuticals.

- The fourth tweet talks about job cuts but doesn't specify how this affects MRK or their stock directly. It might have some negative implications, though, depending on context.

Considering all these, the most significant positive factor is the third tweet promoting Merck as revolutionary. However, without knowing if there are any competing factors like rival companies in diabetes treatment, it's hard to be certain. The overall sentiment could lean towards positive because of the promotion but might have some negative influences from other information or market conditions.

I'm leaning towards a neutral sentiment because while there are some positive signs, the lack of specific details about other factors and the potential for any negatives makes me cautious. But given that one tweet is very supportive, it's better to consider it as positive enough."
2015-08-20,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on a stock's future price. I'm not entirely sure about all the stocks mentioned here, but I can work with what I have.

First, looking at tweet number 1: It seems like it's some kind of link or message from AT_USER cicada 3301. The rest of the words are probably irrelevant because they look like random hashtags or something. But since it's an username, maybe it's a typo or just extra text that doesn't contribute to any meaningful information. So, this tweet probably isn't directly related to the stock I'm looking at.

Now, moving on to tweet number 2: It mentions jimmy carter and his doctors confirming he's receiving keytruda, a drug for melanoma (cancer). Then it says $ mrk. Hmm, mrk might be the ticker symbol for some company, maybe related to medicine or health. The mention of keytruda suggests they're in the health or medical field. I don't know the exact stock, but if jimmy carter is a known individual who gets certain drugs and mentions their success, that could imply good news.

Wait, but without knowing which stock we're talking about, it's hard to assess. Maybe keytruda is a well-known medication? If so, getting positive reviews or a successful diagnosis by jimmy carter could boost the company's performance. That would mean a Positive sentiment.

But I'm not sure if mrk is a real stock symbol or if I should consider other factors. Also, without more context about the stock, it's challenging to say for certain whether this tweet is positive or negative.

So, considering that one of the tweets might be positive (like mentioning successful treatment) and another could be negative (if something bad happens), but since we don't know which is which, I can't make a definitive conclusion. However, if both are related positively to the stock, maybe it's positive overall.

Wait, in tweet 2, there's $ mrk at the end, which might suggest that this is an investment stock or something. If they're confirming successful treatment and the stock goes up, then yes, that would be a Positive impact. Otherwise, if there was any negative information, like potential side effects or financial problems, it could be Negative.

Since I don't have the exact company, it's tricky. But maybe based on the context of keytruda being a drug for cancer and successful treatment mentioned by jimmy carter, it leans towards a positive outlook. So, overall sentiment would probably be Positive."
2015-08-21,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem step by step. So, I have these three tweets and I need to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The options are [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, looking at each tweet individually might be tricky because they don't specify which stock they're referring to. But since all the tweets mention ""mrk,"" that's likely the stock symbol for maybe Bayer? Or maybe an insurance company. Hmm, I'm not sure about their actual names, but maybe it doesn't matter as long as I focus on the trends.

Starting with tweet 1: ""big moment for new immuno-oncology drugs as pres . jimmy carter begins to battle metastatic stage iv melanoma . $ mrk $ bmy pharma."" So Jimmyarter is fighting a cancer disease, which could positively impact any company related to medical treatments. Since it's mentioning drug developments, maybe this tweet is positive for Bayer or another biotech firm.

Next, tweet 2: ""novartis ag ( adr ) declines as merck andamp ; co . , wins patent battle $ mrk URL."" Novartis has been involved in clinical trials, specifically with Merck. This looks like a competitive move to secure a patent. If they're winning the patent battle, that might lead to more revenue or better innovation, which could be positive for their stock.

Then, tweet 3: ""$ mrk sentiment rise to : 0.78 , change : +0.77 , sdr : 1.22 , 1h , 10:00 am , nyse $ spy $ dji."" The sentiment here is pretty high with a score of 0.78, which suggests strong positive emotions. The SDR (S&P 500 index) also has a value of 1.22, indicating overall bullish momentum in the market.

Putting it all together: All three tweets are pointing towards strong performance for mrk, either through drug developments or competitive advancements. The positive sentiment scores and the upward trend in both mrk and S&P suggest that these factors are driving up investor confidence. So, combining these, the stock is expected to be positive."

2015-08-24,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet and wants me to determine its likely impact on the future stock price of a company. They've given specific instructions on how to analyze it, so I'll follow those carefully.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweet. Looking at the tweet, it mentions ""new weapons shift the odds in the war against cancer."" That doesn't directly mention any stocks, which is confusing. Maybe it's a typo or maybe there are missing elements. Alternatively, perhaps the tweet is trying to express a positive outlook on some stock, but without more context, it's hard to pin down.

Wait, let me check again. The tweet says ""new weapons shift the odds in the war against cancer."" It doesn't specify which company that refers to or any particular stock symbol. Without identifying the stock, I can't assess its impact on the price. That’s a problem because the user wants an assessment based on given tweets and target stocks.

Perhaps there's more context missing here. Maybe some of the other tweets in the list provided earlier could hint at what the tweet is about? But as it stands, the information is incomplete since the stock symbol isn't clear from the given tweet.

I wonder if I'm misinterpreting something or if there’s a typo in the tweet. It might be that ""mrk"" refers to a company's ticker symbol, but without knowing which one, it's impossible to evaluate the sentiment towards that specific stock. Since I don’t have access to all the tweets and their relevant information about each stock, I can't accurately determine the overall sentiment.

In conclusion, without identifying the target stock from the tweet, I can't proceed with my analysis. There's not enough information provided to make an accurate assessment of how this tweet affects any particular company's stock price."
2015-08-25,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me break down what each part of the query says.

First, I see two tweets provided. Both seem to mention ""big new picks"" and talk about gains in the past year with massive increases. The words like ""URL breakout,"" ""$ insy,"" and ""mrk"" are present. These might be indicators that something positive is happening related to the company.

In the first tweet, it says after 3,000% gains, there's a major new pick out! It also mentions a URL breakout and updates on $ insy and mrk. The word ""big"" suggests significant changes or favorable news, which could indicate a positive outlook.

The second tweet is identical to the first: our penny stock picks have been seeing massive gains. Again, ""massive gains"" and the mention of new picks indicate that investors might be excited about something coming up.

Since both tweets are talking about increases in gains and mentioning positive developments (like $ insy being updated), they're likely signaling a positive trend for the company's performance. Investors usually react positively when news is exciting, so this could boost the stock price.

Putting it all together, there are no negative or neutral factors mentioned here. The tweets are all about increasing gains and updating on something positive. So the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-08-26,Positive,"Alright, let's analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on pypl's stock price.

Starting with the first tweet, ""pypl qualcomm inc . e . p . s . URL $ pypl pennystocks pennystocks."" It mentions Qualcomm and URLs, which might just be placeholders or typos. The words ""pennystocks"" are repeated multiple times, indicating a strong sentiment of support for the stock. This could be a positive sign suggesting good news.

The second tweet is "" $ cat news updated wednesday , august 26 , 2015 12:07 : 41 pm $ swks $ cf $ tcel $ mrk URL."" Here, there's mention of cat news on August 26th. While I don't have information on the specific content or its implications, it's worth considering if it could be positive or negative.

Looking at Twitter trends and events in August 2015, events like the U.S. election season were significant but generally considered neutral or mixed. If there was any positive news related to pypl during that time, it might boost sentiment, but without specific details, it's hard to say.

The third tweet ""mrk merck & co . , inc . short sales URL $ mrk $ wfc $ ewz $ dust mrk pennystocks stockmarket."" Short sales and the presence of multiple companies (wfc, ewz, dust) could indicate investor confidence in the stock. Positive aspects like short-term gains might be considered.

There are other tweets with ""cop"" related to prices and earnings, which again don't give specific info but could imply either positive or neutral sentiment based on broader market reactions.

Overall, considering all these factors—qualcomm's support is strong, there's mention of stock movements and a general trend towards stock gains—it seems the overall sentiment is positive. The repeated words like ""pennystocks"" likely contribute to a positive outlook, even if other tweets are mixed."
2015-08-27,Missing,File not found
2015-08-28,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""btu peabody energy corp . news URL $ btu $ mrk $ tcel $ rsp btu nasdaq sharec citigroup , inc . yield …"" Hmm, it seems like the stock symbol is ""mrk"", which stands for MRK, a company I'm familiar with as a major oil producer. So the stock in question is MRK.

Now, tweet 2 says: ""mrk merck & co . , inc . ask size URL $ mrk $ vz $ dust $ shld mrk stock invest"". This also mentions MRK again, so it's the same stock.

Next, I need to break down each tweet into positive and negative factors. For tweet 1, I see ""yield"", which probably affects a company's profitability. Then there are ""msft"" or ""nasdaq sharec"", but I'm not sure what that refers to. It could be something like ""shared earnings"" or ""new products"". The phrase ""$ mrk stock invest"" suggests the stock is being actively traded.

For tweet 2, ""size URL vz dust shld"" again relates to company size or valuation metrics, and ""$ mrk stock invest"" reinforces the idea that MRK is in the trading market.

Now, assessing the sentiment. Tweet 1 mentions yield, which might indicate economic conditions affecting profitability. If yields are up, it could mean good earnings, so that's positive. The mention of ""msft"" or ""nasdaq sharec"" doesn't clarify much about performance. Tweet 2 just reinforces MRK being involved in investments.

Combining these, the main positive factor is the yield mentioned in tweet 1. While other tweets suggest MRK is a popular stock, there's no direct info on performance yet. So overall, it seems like there are some positive elements pointing towards a favorable outlook."

2015-08-31,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. The first tweet talks about the market being on the mend and mentions blue chips with fat dividends. This doesn't seem specific enough; it could be referring to any company or sector. Without knowing which company's stock this tweet is about, I can't extract a precise symbol.

2. The second tweet mentions a guy making millions and watching a video proof. Again, too vague without context.

3. The third tweet discusses JNJ trading ideas on finance sites and references the SPDR JNJ bond ETF. This seems related to financial services or bond ETFs. The stock here is likely jnk (SPDR JNKX).

4. The fourth tweet has a URL reference and talks about PFE, mentioning something about Chinese TCM or regulated cures versus quackery. This also doesn't specify the company's symbol.

Since I don't have the exact stock symbols, it's challenging to assess sentiment directly. Without knowing what each tweet is about, I can't accurately determine if the messages are positive, neutral, or negative regarding a specific stock. Maybe some context is missing, but I think these tweets are more about discussing trends in bonds or markets rather than pointing towards a particular company.

Therefore, without knowing which stock to evaluate, it's impossible to classify their impact on the future stock price."
2015-09-01,Missing,File not found
2015-09-02,Positive,"Okay, let's break down how I approached this analysis for the given tweets to determine their impact on the stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The first tweet mentions ""mrk"" and ""lgnd"", which are penny stocks. So, that would be Microsoft (MSFT) since lgnd is also a known penny stock, though not as well-known as Microsoft.

Next, for each tweet, I separated them into positive and negative factors. In the second tweet, it's all about Unis, which doesn't directly relate to any specific stock, so those could be neutral or neither. The third tweet talks about MRK with some technical indicators like P-1%, R-0.177%, LOD 53.2300, and perf 1.3%. This is mostly technical, indicating potential for a price movement but not a major sentiment shift yet.

Now, assessing each tweet's impact on investor sentiment. The first tweet says subscribers are up by 578% and mentions a penny stock launch, which could be positive as it might attract more attention and investors might react positively if they're excited about the new company. However, sometimes such announcements can cause speculative movements, but since it's just a new penny stock, maybe it's still moderate.

The second tweet is all about Unis, which isn't specific to any stock. So these could be considered neutral because without knowing which stock is being referred to, it's hard to gauge sentiment. Unis might be misinterpreted by investors, leading them to buy or sell regardless of actual stock performance.

The third tweet is technical with some price range and volatility indicators but doesn't mention a specific stock. Technical analysis can sometimes lead investors astray unless there are clear signals from the data provided. The 1% increase in P/E ratio might indicate some confidence, but it's not strong enough on its own without context about the stock performance.

Combining these thoughts: The first tweet is positive due to excitement and potential for a penny stock launch. However, the second tweet doesn't directly relate to a stock, so it's too vague. The third tweet provides technical clues that might tip in either direction but isn't enough to strongly influence investor sentiment. But since there are multiple tweets indicating potential for growth, especially with MRK being an expanding company and Unis possibly having positive momentum, I'm leaning toward a positive overall sentiment.

So putting it all together, the overall impact on the stock price seems likely to be positive due to several factors that might push investors up."

2015-09-10,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out if they're going to have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on a company's stock price. The user provided specific tweets and an output requirement where I should conclude with one of those three tags: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

Let me start by looking at the first tweet. It says ""rt AT_USER icymi : merck's keytruda : a remarkable science-to-success story URL $ mrk fda keytruda rh15 pharma …"" The word ""keytruda"" stands out to me, which I think is related to drug development. Merck is a big pharmaceutical company known for its R&D efforts and various drugs. So this tweet seems positive because it's talking about their success in key areas like drug discovery or development. It mentions FDA and pharma, which are key players in the industry. The rest of the text is just some link-building stuff.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER icymi : merck's keytruda : a remarkable science-to-success story URL $ mrk fda keytruda rh15 pharma …"" Wait, that seems repetitive. It's the same as the first tweet but in different words and maybe using some other synonyms or formatting. So it reinforces the same point about Merck's success in drug development.

The third tweet is ""rt AT_USER icymi : merck's keytruda : a remarkable science-to-success story URL $ mrk fda keytruda rh15 pharma …"" Same pattern again. It just repeats the same message with slight variations. No new information here, it's just reiterating their success and connection to Merck.

Now, considering all three tweets are about Merck's keytruda drug development story and their strong position in the pharmaceutical industry (as indicated by FDA and pharma references), each tweet reinforces these points without introducing any negative or conflicting ideas. Each one is positive because they highlight Merck's commitment to innovation and success.

So, putting it all together: All three tweets are focused on Merck, emphasizing their achievements in drug development and the pharmaceutical sector. They're not negative; instead, they're reinforcing the company's strengths and contributions. Therefore, overall, the sentiment seems positive."
2015-09-11,Missing,File not found
2015-09-12,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. So, first off, I need to understand what each tweet is saying and how it's relevant to investing.

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER auy yamana gold inc . quotes URL $ auy $ mu $ mrk $ hgu.to auy tradeideas invest"". Okay, so the user is quoting the company and mentions keywords like ""quotes"", ""url"", ""mu"", ""mrk"", ""hgu"". It seems like they're promoting something related to trading or investing on platforms. They mention trade ideas and investment strategies.

Now, when analyzing stock sentiment from a tweet, one common approach is to look at words that have positive or negative connotations. Words like "" quotes "", "" mu "", "" mrk "", etc., might indicate strong support for the stock because they're using technical terms related to trading. These terms are often associated with professional investors and trading strategies.

On the other hand, if a tweet mentions something that suggests the company is undervalued or doesn't have much growth potential, it could be negative. But in this case, all the tweets are promoting the stock for trading purposes without indicating any unfavorable factors like low profit margins or high debt.

So, considering that these tweets are solely about promoting trading ideas and suggesting investments, the overall sentiment seems positive because they're encouraging a market-driven approach rather than speculative claims about the company's performance. The user is likely trying to drive trading activity by offering information on where to trade and what strategies might work.

Therefore, putting it all together, despite not mentioning specific negative factors like earnings or revenue growth, these tweets seem to be promoting the stock in a way that could positively influence investors. Thus, the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-09-13,Neutral,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets trying to figure out their impact on stock prices for a company. The user provided a specific set of steps and an example output. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""a sleep well , long-term orientated portfolio from the s & p 500 URL $ gild $ etn $ wmt $ xom $ mmm $ jnj $ mrk"". Hmm, this looks like a stock ticker symbol. I don't think it's an actual stock price. Maybe they're just listing the company in the tweet? That seems odd because stock symbols are usually different from the stock prices. So if that's the case, maybe it doesn't make sense to analyze its impact on the stock price since it's not a real symbol but rather a reference or listing.

Second tweet: ""Long-term orientated portfolio from s & p 500 URL $ gild $ etn $ wmt $ xom $ mmm $ jnj $ mrk"". Similar situation here. This could be referring to the same stock mentioned before, just in different case. So again, it's not a real symbol but part of the tweet text.

Third tweet: ""Sleep better on sleep, long-term oriented portfolio from s & p 500 URL $ gild $ etn $ wmt $ xom $ mmm $ jnj $ mrk"". Again, same structure as the first two tweets. It's listing the stock in a way that doesn't make sense for an actual stock symbol or price.

Putting this together, all three tweets are just listing the stock without providing any information about its performance. Since I can't analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price because they don't contain any real data or metrics related to the stock's performance, I should conclude that there's no significant information provided. Therefore, my analysis would be neutral.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Are these tweets part of a larger context or series? The user didn't specify, so without more context, it's hard to tell what they're trying to convey about the stock. It could just be an attempt to list the company in a way that doesn't include any price data. So yes, I should stick with the neutral conclusion because no actual information is given."
2015-09-14,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given tweets are positive, neutral, or negative regarding the stock price of a company called Merck & Company, Inc. The tweet is: ""company shares of merck & company , inc . ( nyse : mrk ) rally 0.97 % $ mrk URL""

First, I need to understand what each part of this sentence means. There's the word ""rally"" followed by a percentage and then ""$ mrk URL"". The symbol for Merck is MRK.

Breaking it down: ""rally"" indicates that the stock has gone up. The 0.97% increase suggests that this week, their shares have gone up by about 1%. The presence of $ mrk URL in the tweet also likely means the stock price is going to rise because they're checking if the symbol is correct or not.

So, all these pieces together suggest that the company's shares are expected to go up. That should translate into a positive outlook on their stock."
2015-09-15,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. I'm not too familiar with all financial terms, so I'll have to go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""we analyse the impact of innovation on beauty consumer behaviour in our latest us research report $ bayn $ ash $ mrk $ dow $ sy1 symrise $ bas"". Hmm, it mentions a research report about innovation affecting beauty consumer behavior. The mention of $ mrk suggests they're related to Merck & Co., which I know is a major drug company. So, this tweet could be indicating that their stock might be affected by changes in innovation trends or market trends overall.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER $ gild been trading similar to $ bmy , $ pfe , $ mrk , and $ abbv past month . its trading like …"" This seems like it's comparing the stock being similar to others. The words like ""similar to"" could mean that this company might be performing similarly or perhaps it's being discussed in a context where other companies are doing well, which could influence investor sentiment.

The third tweet: ""jbem ' pick rxii upcoming catalyst : read here : URL $ mrns $ eni $ betr $ lxrx $ mrk $ anip $ cyh $ alr"". Here, there's a mention of the mrk stock and some country codes like ENI, CBT, etc. The ""mrns"" could be a typo for ""MRN"", but without more context, it's hard to tell. The links might suggest that this is related to the company, possibly indicating positive news about their performance.

The fourth tweet: ""merck & co . , inc . publishes 2014 global corporate responsibility report $ mrk URL"". This one directly mentions a report from Merck, which is a large company. This could mean they've released information about corporate responsibility, which might be related to their stock price—maybe it affects their reputation or future projects.

The fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER two companies with near term fda catalysts - URL $ rlyp $ mrk $ sny biotech fda"". Here, it mentions the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) as a catalyst. The FDA is involved in certain medications, so if there are near-term catalysts for companies related to them, that could positively or negatively impact their stock.

Now, combining all these points: The first tweet relates to Merck's innovation impact on beauty consumers. The third and fourth tweets mention the company's recent reports. The fifth tweet talks about FDA-related developments. If the overall sentiment is positive, it might mean the companies are doing well, receiving good news, or their products or services align with regulations.

I'm not sure how all these factors directly translate to stock movements, but I think there's some overlap in trends and maybe supportive information could push things up."
2015-09-16,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for stock market impact. So, the user provided a tweet and wants an analysis of its likely effect on the company's future stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweet. Looking at the text: ""our stock picks gained over 1,500 % i nthe past 2 months ! gain early access to our new pick : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"". The key part here is ""url breakout $ insy $ mrk"", which seems like the ticker symbol. So, I think the company's stock symbol is INSY.

Next, I have to break down each tweet and analyze its factors. There are two tweets: Number 1 and Number 2.

For Number 1:
- The first part says ""our stock picks gained over 1,500 % i nthe past 2 months."" This suggests that the company has had significant growth in recent months, which is positive.
- Then it mentions ""gain early access to our new pick."" Access to new products or services can attract investors and boost earnings. This seems like a good sign for future performance.

Number 2 isn't provided, but from context, I know INSY stands for Insufficient Funds for Your Checks (insy.com) and Insufficient Funds for Your Records (mrk.com). These companies often deal with financial issues where customers have insufficient funds. However, the tweet doesn't provide specific information about the company's current situation or any earnings reports.

So, summarizing:
- Number 1: Positive factors like growth in picks and access to new products make it a strong indicator of positive sentiment.
- Number 2: Without specifics, I can't assess its impact. It might be a bit speculative but could have mixed effects based on the underlying issues.

Putting it all together, the overall sentiment is positive because there are significant positive factors mentioned, such as growth and access to new products.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll structure this into the required output format."

2015-09-19,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. Let me start by parsing what each tweet is saying.

First, looking at ""iwm russell 2000 ishares market cap URL $ iwm $ gs $ mrk $ axgn iwm finance stocks"". Hmm, that seems a bit confusing with multiple addresses and symbols like Russell 2000 and Ishares. I'm not entirely sure what this means. Maybe it's part of a typo or some kind of code? Not sure if ""iwm"" refers to something specific. 

Then there are several mentions of the stock symbols gs, mrk, axgn, and finance stocks. That doesn't immediately strike me as anything obvious in terms of market trends. They could be suggesting that the company is involved with other stocks or perhaps it's part of a different context.

Since each tweet seems to just list various stock symbols and mentions other stocks, I can't really find a clear positive, negative, or neutral sentiment from them. They're all just listing things without any indication of improvement or decline in stock performance.

I think the best way is to say that based on these tweets, there's no significant information about how this company will perform. So, the overall impact is likely [Neutral]."
2015-09-20,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, the user wants me to analyze some tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company and then conclude with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""mrk merck & co . , inc . stock message board URL $ mrk $ luv $ slb $ gmcr mrk stocks finance"". The stock symbol here is MRK. That seems pretty clear.

Next, each tweet needs to be analyzed individually for positive and negative factors. Let's go through them one by one.

The first tweet talks about aomeric stocks making gains over 100% in two months, so that's definitely positive. It also mentions a ""big new pick,"" which implies potential buy signals. So both Positive and Negative aspects here are present.

The second tweet is about XLOV, an investment firm in the health care sector. It mentions increased confidence due to a breakout over 100% gains. This suggests that investor sentiment is positive towards XLOV. However, the language used might be a bit off, so I should check if it's clear and relevant.

The third tweet says that our peny stock alert gained 1,000% in two months with a big new pick. Again, multiple positive terms are used, reinforcing a strong sentiment towards this stock.

Now, evaluating each tweet for sentiment:

1.mrk mentions gains of 100% or more, which is very positive.
2.xlv also talks about increased confidence and gains over 100%, so it's mixed in some ways but still considered positive.
3.insy mentions a big new pick with gains, which is clear positive.

Overall, all three tweets are providing information that suggests the stock might be going up. The fact that multiple sources are bringing in positive terms makes me lean towards a [Positive] sentiment overall. Even though there's some ambiguity, the key points indicate strong optimism about MRK."
2015-09-21,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. The target here is Merck (MRK). 

Looking at the first tweet: ""merck : des résultats favorables contre le c . difficile . URL $ mrk"" It seems like it's listing a positive result against something called ""c . difficile."" I'm not entirely sure what ""c . difficile"" refers to, but given that Merck is often associated with ""cancer research,"" maybe it's about their cancer treatment efforts. The tweet is followed by a URL with $mrk, which could indicate an investment alert or new information.

So the factors here are Positive results related to cancer treatment (likely good) and Negative results elsewhere—could be any negative points not related to Merck. 

Next, I need to assess the sentiment for each factor. The positive result seems positive, as it's about favorable outcomes in their cancer research area, which is a strong point for investors looking at Merck. On the flip side, there are other results that aren't specifically linked to Merck, but they could be negative if they're pointing towards something else.

Now, combining these factors—positive on certain fronts and some negatives elsewhere—it's a mix of positive and neutral sentiments. The overall sentiment seems mixed because while some things are good for investors looking at Merck, others might not contribute positively either.

I'm leaning towards a Neutral overall sentiment because there aren't enough clear positives to outweigh the negatives or vice versa."
2015-09-22,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about stock price movements for a company's impact on their future stock price. The user provided a set of tweets where each tweet mentions some Dow Jones stocks. My task is to determine whether the overall effect will be positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from these tweets. Looking at the tweets given: 10 Dow Jones heavyweights breaking down $axp$, $apl$, $mrk$, $utx$, and $gs$. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because some of these names don't look familiar as company names. Maybe it's a typo or perhaps the user intended to refer to specific stocks. I should double-check if these are actual stock symbols.

Once I have the target stock symbol, say it's AXP, which is a well-known Dow Jones stock. Then for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

Looking at the tweets, they all mention multiple stocks breaking down their prices, perhaps indicating a general trend among these stocks moving in a particular direction. For example, some could be suggesting that certain stocks are undervalued or overvalued relative to others.

Next, I have to assess the sentiment of each tweet. Positive tweets might talk about expected growth, profit expectations, or company prospects. Negative ones might mention stock performance, risks, or upcoming events. The key is to gauge whether these tweets suggest an overall bullish or bearish outlook on the group of stocks.

After categorizing each tweet, I'll look for a trend—do all positive tweets outweigh negative ones? Or are there equal parts both ways? If more positive influences seem likely, the stock might go up. If the information is contradictory or uncertain, it could remain neutral. But if multiple negative signals point to a decline, the overall sentiment would be negative.

In this case, without knowing the exact content of each tweet beyond mentioning breaking down prices and including URLs, I can't get precise data. However, given that these are Dow Jones stocks, any mention of broader market trends could suggest an overall positive or negative impact.

Wait, I'm not sure about the specific stocks mentioned in the tweets. Maybe there's a pattern in the language used—some talking about gains, others about losses? If more tweets indicate expected increases, it leans towards positive sentiment. Conversely, if several mention unexpected declines, that might be a mix.

I also have to consider factors like market speculation or company-specific news affecting these stocks. But without specific information, I can't make an exact prediction. So, my conclusion will depend on balancing the general trends and any individual tweet nuances."
2015-09-23,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price of Unisys (UNIS). Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually and noting the factors mentioned. For example, the first tweet says ""unis - getting the bum's rush URL $ amgn $ bdx $ biib $ biod $ cov $ dskx $ goog $ bmy $ jnj $ pg $ imnp $ mrk $ rtrx $ rvp $ sny $ pfe."" I notice a bunch of symbols here, which probably means Unisys is part of a larger company or stock symbol. But without more context, it's hard to tell if they're positive or negative.

Then there are tweets like ""mrk $ mrk - top tech股$ biib"" and ""pfe $ pfe - financial institution."" These seem straightforward with just one word followed by the stock symbol. So, perhaps each tweet is pointing towards Unisys being a strong player in its field.

Next, I need to assess the sentiment of each tweet. For example, if a tweet mentions upcoming earnings or significant news about Unisys, that could boost the positive score. If it talks about potential threats or problems, that would decrease the negative impact. The key is to look for any vague terms and decide based on what's stated.

Combining all these tweets, I can see multiple stocks mentioned, but without specific information on earnings, competition, or news affecting Unisys, it's hard to say definitively. However, since some tweets are about upcoming tech successes and others are about financial institutions, which might indicate growth areas, the positive sentiment seems likely.

I'm not sure if any of these tweets mention specific stock prices or performance metrics, so I can't directly compare the current stock price against historical data. Maybe they're just highlighting Unisys's contributions to broader sectors that positively impact the overall market.

Overall, despite not having all the details, the presence of multiple positive mentions and potential growth areas seems to lean towards a positive outlook for Unisys."
2015-09-24,Positive,"Alright, let me figure out how to approach this problem step by step.

First, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. The user provided four tweets, and my task is to analyze them using a specific method. Let's break down each step as outlined in the solving process.

Starting with identifying the target stock: Each tweet mentions ""mrk"" which is likely the ticker symbol for MRK, also known as Modern Materials Inc. So I'll focus on analyzing how these tweets affect MRK's stock price.

Next, I need to separate the factors and assess sentiment. For each tweet, I have to find positive and negative factors related to the stock. Then evaluate if those factors influence investor sentiment positively, negatively, or neutrally.

Looking at the first tweet: ""mrk merck & co . , inc . company info URL $ mrk $ ampe $ cvx $ frc.to mrk invest nasdaq."" The mention of company info and investment URLs seems like a positive sign. It might encourage investors to follow or be informed about the stock, which could lead to more buy interest.

The second tweet: ""eem ishares msci emerging markets exchange URL $ eem $ mrk $ trvn $ tza eem invest share."" This mentions another ETF (EEM) and ESM. While it's a financial term, it doesn't directly affect MRK's stock price but might be related to the broader market or ETFs.

The third tweet: ""our peny stock alerts gained over 1,000 % in just over 2 months ! see our big new pick : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"" Here, it specifically mentions that the Penys stock has grown by more than 1000% in two months. This is a significant positive news that could attract many investors. It's a bold statement suggesting a potential breakthrough or signal to buy, which would likely increase MRK's demand.

The fourth tweet: ""our pick on $ hcti has nearly tripled in value , in the past 3 weeks ! get our next pick early : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"" This one talks about another ETF (HCTI) that has tripled in value over three weeks. It's again a positive statement, which might encourage buying MRK because of the growth potential of HCTI.

Now, summarizing the factors and sentiments:

1. Company info and investments: Positive.
2. Emerging markets and ESM: Not directly affecting MRK, but a related topic.
3. Penys stock outperforms expectations: Strong positive sentiment from the investor side.
4. HCTI's value increase: Another positive statement for investors.

Combining these factors, each tweet presents strong bullish signals to potential buyers. Investors are encouraged to buy, which should lead to an upward trend in MRK's stock price.

Thus, considering all these factors and sentiments together, it seems the overall sentiment is positively affecting the stock."
2015-09-25,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The user provided two tweets related to Merck (MRK), which is a well-known pharmaceutical company.

Looking at the first tweet: ""merck kgaa given € 103.10 pt by warburg research . buy rating . URL $ mrk mrk"". This seems pretty straightforward. It mentions that Merck was upgraded from Neutral to买入, indicating positive sentiment from Warburg Research. They're now selling their stock at a higher price and looking for the user's contact info, which could be useful. Buy ratings suggest increased investor interest in acquiring Merck. So this tweet is positive because it's improving the outlook on the company and gathering more information that might drive buyer interest.

Now the second tweet: ""mrk mrk"". It just says the same thing again, ""mrk mrk"" without any additional information or updates. This doesn't provide new data but repeats what was already mentioned. Since it's not offering any new insights or opinions, it's more neutral in terms of sentiment.

Putting this together, the first tweet is positive because it gives a clear upgrade and sets expectations for future action. The second tweet is neutral because there's no additional information to affect sentiment. Therefore, the overall impact is predominantly positive based on the first tweet."
2015-09-26,Missing,File not found
2015-09-27,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative about the stock. Let's take the first tweet: ""Cree cree , inc . investor opinions URL $ cree $ deck $ mrk $ cnr.to Cree nasdaq share."" Hmm, that seems a bit off. It mentions Cree, which might be a typo because I know CREE isn't a real company. The rest looks like it's about investor opinions and stock shares. Maybe the sentiment is positive because investors are sharing their thoughts about the market.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""ewj japan ishares market cap URL $ ewj $ aezs $ mrk $ mtn ewj stocks finance."" This one also has some typos like ewj and aezs, but it's talking about investment firms in Japan. They mention their market cap, which could imply they're looking to grow, so maybe positive sentiment.

I'm not sure if these tweets are directly related to the stock, but their content might reflect investor opinions on the company's performance or financial health."
2015-09-28,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The goal here is to identify whether it's positive, negative, or neutral in terms of sentiment towards the stock. But wait, the user didn't specify which stock they're referring to because the target stock symbol isn't provided. Hmm, that might complicate things a bit.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions something about who won Eccler's 2015 election and talks about some cryptocurrencies like $exel, $rhhby, etc., ending with asking for an exclamation mark. That seems more like a gaming or speculation tweet rather than one that would impact stock prices significantly.

2. The second tweet is about ProShares, mentions ultrashort basics materials, last price URL, and mentions mrk. This looks like another financial or investment-related tweet. It's a short message with some links and numbers, so it might be related to the stock performance of ProShares.

3. The third tweet from efa includes MSCI index fund summary and refers to $eaa shares on pennystocks. Again, this seems more about investing or market trends rather than directly impacting a specific stock's price.

4. The fourth tweet discusses high-performing beverage company TBEV, their data, and mentions Amazon. This is definitely financial related again, focusing on another company in the market.

Since none of these tweets specify which stock they're talking about, I can't determine any direct impact on that particular stock's price. However, each tweet seems to be offering information about broader markets or companies in the same sector as ProShares or others mentioned in the tweets.

Considering that these are all financial-related tweets, and without knowing the exact target stock symbol, it's challenging to assess the sentiment directly. But maybe I can infer some trends. For example, if many tweets mention investing tips, tech companies (like Apple, Amazon), or specific sectors like beverages, that might indicate a general positive sentiment among investors.

But again, without knowing which stock we're talking about, it's hard to say definitively whether each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral in terms of the stock's price. Each tweet could be influencing different stocks within their respective categories.

So, given the uncertainty due to missing information about the target stock symbol and the nature of these tweets being broader financial advice rather than specific stock updates, I think it's safest to leave this analysis incomplete. But perhaps the user can provide more context or clarify which stock they're referring to."
2015-09-29,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Mrk. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

The first tweet mentions fxi shares and the FTSE China 25 index fund with a dividend. This seems like positive news because it's about diversification and financial growth, which could benefit investors. But I'm not sure if this is enough on its own for Mrk's price.

The second tweet brings in MRK and mentions market cap data. While this shows the company's size, it doesn't necessarily translate to a stock performance without more context.

Third tweet also includes MRK with EOD data from XPO, HZNPs, etc., but again, no direct financial information about Mrk.

Then there are two identical tweets starting (3/3) and mentioning Jules Levinson's thoughts on the American population. This is quite controversial, talking about misinformation. That could be a red flag because it might lead to negative sentiment if people get concerned about the information being true or misleading.

Lastly, the third tweet continues with TQQQ and ultrapro stocks yielding money, which suggests some investment opportunities but not clear positive news related to MRK.

Putting all these together, I think there's mixed signals. Some tweets are positive about the company's diversification, others mention EOD data without context, and one is critically evaluating a topic that could affect public sentiment. The critical tweet might overshadow the others. Without more concrete information or if MRk's fundamentals improve, it's hard to say for sure.

Considering all these factors, I think the overall impact might be neutral because there are both positive and negative signals, but the critical tweet could swing things in a downward direction."
2015-09-30,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. Let me start by breaking down each tweet step by step.

First, let's identify the target stock from the first tweet: ""url mrk $ bmy $ shpg $ agn $ gild"". Hmm, that seems like it might be related to specific companies under MRK or similar symbols. I'll need to note that and see if there's any overlap with other tweets.

The second tweet is ""our winning stock picks gained over 2,000 % in 3 months ! get early access to our new picks : url breakout $ insy $ mrk"". This looks like a positive one because it mentions a significant gain from picking stocks and offering early access. That's encouraging for investors.

The third tweet is ""AT_USER don't believe the street gets concept-open data - $ halo has up to the min updates on 202 data-shared w $ mrk - now trial = valid'n"". This seems a bit confusing with some terms I'm not familiar with, like ""concept-open data"" and ""data-shared"". It might be talking about something specific related to MRK. The mention of sharing data up to the minimum updates and then making it a trial or validation could imply that these are important updates for the stock.

Now, looking at the factors in each tweet: for the first, it's several stocks mentioned with prices and URLs, but without specific information on whether they're positive or negative. The second tweet is clearly positive about gains and stock picks. The third one has vague terms but mentions sharing data which could be seen as beneficial.

Assessing sentiment: The second tweet directly mentions a gain in stock picks, which boosts investor confidence. The third tweet's details are unclear, but the mention of updating or validating data might indicate that it's providing useful information to investors, possibly positive. The first tweet provides company info without specific sentiment cues except for the URL links, which I don't know much about.

Combining these, the second and third tweets seem more impactful. The second is very clear with a boost in stock picks, while the third has some positive information but might be seen as providing updates rather than negative factors. So overall, there are strong positive signals from both tweets."
2015-10-01,Missing,File not found
2015-10-02,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of $MRK. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The user provided a few tweets, but they all mention ""mrk"" except for the first one which mentions ""bmy"". Maybe that's another company? Hmm, not sure yet. But looking at others:

1. The first tweet talks about BMY or PFE merging with BRistol-Myers and getting approvals for a cancer drug.
2. Second tweet is a label comment from $MRK whose tumors express PD-L1. It doesn't mention a stock but seems to be indicating something about the company's product.
3. Third tweet says it's amazing what $MRK has done in moving keytruda forward with a smart, speedy clinical development program.

4. The fourth is another label comment from $MRK near 52-week lows and not priced for broad labels.

Now, I'm thinking about what each tweet is suggesting regarding $MRK's stock. 

The first tweet mentions BMY or PFE getting FDA approvals, which could imply a merger that might be good news. But without knowing if this affects $MRK directly, it's hard to tell if that impacts its price.

The second tweet is about PD-L1 expression in tumors. PD-L1 is a protein involved in cancer treatment. If the company is showing interest or development related to this, but again, not sure how that translates to stock sentiment.

The third tweet talks about $MRK moving forward with keytruda, which suggests advancements in their product. This might be a positive sign for investors who trust the company's progress.

The fourth is another PD-L1 comment, similar to the second, indicating interest or development related to cancer treatment but no direct stock impact mentioned.

Looking at all of them together: some talk about mergers or partnerships (first tweet), others are talking about product advancements and clinical trials (third and fourth). These could indicate positive developments that might boost investor confidence. But without knowing if these moves are leading towards a merger or actual product launches, it's hard to say definitively.

However, the third tweet specifically mentions keytruda moving forward with smart and speedy development, which is significant. That suggests they're on the right track for a product launch, which could drive demand and possibly increase stock prices.

But I also need to consider other factors like media coverage. The first tweet's mention of FDA approvals might show potential future developments or partnerships, though it doesn't directly relate to $MRK's stock price unless this is part of their strategy for acquiring BRistol-Myers, which isn't clear from the context given.

Putting it all together, while there are mentions of product advancements and company strategies, without more specific information about how these moves align with actual stock performance or if they lead to actual changes in $MRK's financials, I can't be entirely certain. However, several positive elements like advancing keytruda seem to suggest potential improvement, which might contribute to a positive overall sentiment.

So, tentatively, I'll lean towards the stock being positively influenced because of the product advancements and strategic moves indicated."

2015-10-04,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about a company's stock performance based on their impact on the future stock price. The user has provided three tweets and wants me to determine if they are positive, neutral, or negative overall.

First, let me look at each tweet individually. 

The first tweet says: ""$ mrk : gr merck kgaa : serono awards grant for growth innovation at espe in barcelona merck kgaa URL stoxx 600"". Hmm, I see some keywords like ""serono awards grant for growth innovation"" and the stock ticker ""mrk"" which is likely MRK (Massachusetts General Electric Company), a utility company. The phrase ""espe"" might be a typo or specific industry, but overall, it seems to mention a major award or funding to their stock based on a URL related to a city called Barcelona.

The second tweet isn't provided, so I can't analyze that one. But for the third tweet: ""$ mrk : mrk mrk kgaa : serono awards grant for growth innovation at espe in barcelona merck kgaa url stoxx 600"". This looks similar to the first but possibly with a different URL or phrasing. It again mentions an award for growth innovation and links it to MRK, possibly another utility company.

Since I don't have information on the second tweet, maybe it's either neutral or negative based on the context without details. But let me focus on what I can analyze. The key elements are awards, grants for growth and innovation, and mentions of a stock ticker (could be the target company) which seems to be involved in utilities.

Assuming all relevant tweets mention awards, grants, or positive aspects related to their stock performance, it's likely reinforcing investor confidence. Thus, the sentiment would be positive."
2015-10-05,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of each tweet on the stock price. The user provided two tweets and asked me to analyze their likely effects. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER william campbell's nobel is a big deal for pharma and for $ mrk . a drug company changed the world for the better."" This seems positive because it mentions a significant event related to the Nobel Prize, which affects the pharmaceutical industry. The mention of a drug company changing the world could improve future research or development. 

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER william campbell's nobel is a big deal for pharma and for $ mrk . a drug company changed the world for the better."" Similarly, this also highlights the positive impact of William Campbell's Nobel win on the pharmaceutical sector and the potential improvement in future research. Both tweets are reinforcing the same positive sentiment about the industry.

Since both tweets support an improvement in the company's financial health by highlighting the importance of their work, the overall impact is positive."
2015-10-06,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to analyze the impact of given tweets on a company's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""our penny stock pick on $ gequ is up 3,042 . 86 % for our members so far ! subscribe here : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". The stock symbol mentioned here seems to be ""$ lgnd"". I'll note that as the target stock.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet's factors. Since there are only one tweet provided, it's straightforward. Let me break it down:

1. ""our penny stock pick on $ gequ is up 3,042 . 86 % for our members so far ! subscribe here : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd""

So, the factors here seem to be:
- The stock went up by 3,042%
- It's from ""gequ"", which I'm not sure about. Maybe ""GeQU"" is a typo or stands for something else.
- It mentions that this penny stock was picked by our members and there's a subscription link.

Now, assessing the sentiment: The tweet is positive because it's indicating growth percentage and mentions subscriptions, which are often favorable indicators of investor confidence. The mention of ""penny stock"" further reinforces a positive outlook.

Considering all these elements—positive growth, mention of subscriptions, it's from a company that probably cares about its employees or members—the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-10-07,Missing,File not found
2015-10-08,Positive,"Alright, I'm going to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of Hillary Clancey's company. The goal is to assess each tweet individually and then combine them to give a overall sentiment.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""hillary clinton learn the facts before shooting off your tweet ibb mrk jnj bmy cldx insm nbix gsk thrx URL"". It seems like Hillary is preparing for her tweet or sharing some information. Words like ""learn the facts"" suggest that she's in the process of updating her message, which might indicate preparation and potential confidence. That could be a positive factor as it shows preparedness.

Next, the second tweet: ""celator pharmaceuticals inc $ cpxx form 4 insider buying : scott thomas jackson buys 14450 shares URL rhhby mrk gsk"". This looks like an insider buy order. Form 4 transactions are a big deal in stock trading because they're required by regulators. An insider buy could indicate positive sentiment, possibly due to increased visibility or trust in the company's operations. However, insider buys can sometimes lead to market reactions that aren't always positive, so I'm not entirely sure yet.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet shows Hillary is likely updating her message, which might be good for investor confidence. The second one suggests she has inside info or informed investors about a potential purchase, which could increase the value of their shares. Since both tweets are related to Hillary and mention stock transactions, they probably have a positive impact on the company.

I'm leaning towards a Positive overall sentiment because Hillary's actions indicate good intentions without clear signs of negative news."
2015-10-09,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to analyze these tweets about the stock price of a company based on their impact. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock symbol is mentioned in the tweets. Looking at the last tweet: ""mrk – investment analysts ’ weekly ratings updates URL."" That mentions ""Investment Analysts’ Weekly Ratings Updates,"" so maybe it's a company called MRK. But I'm not entirely sure about that, but I'll assume it's the correct stock symbol.

Now, each tweet is analyzed separately. The first tweet says: ""$ mrk - award-winning actress s . epatha merkerson , merck and the american diabetes association challenge african URL."" This seems like a positive statement because it mentions an award-winning actress, which can be seen as positive, and mentions ""challenge"" about African issues. These elements can create hope or optimism.

The second tweet is: ""qtrrf quaterra resources inc . filings URL $ qtrrf $ hgu.to $ dal $ mrk qtrrf finance invest."" This looks like a stock ticker symbol: QTRRF QTRRF HGU.TO DAL MRK. The format seems familiar, especially after QTRRF. I've heard that QTRRF is a common stock ticker. So this could be referring to a filing or news about Quanterra Resources Inc.

The third tweet: ""vntvvantiv , inc . eod data URL $ vntv $ mrk $ vntv $ xiv vntv finance stockmarket."" Again, similar pattern to the second one. It mentions VNTV and MRK with EOD data URLs. That seems like another stock ticker.

The fourth tweet: ""merck kgaa $ mrk – investment analysts ’ weekly ratings updates URL."" This talks about Merck KGAA updating their weekly ratings, which is a common financial announcement that can be positive or neutral depending on the outcome. If they improve ratings, it's positive; if not, it might stay neutral.

Now, I need to assess each tweet in terms of factors and sentiment. 

First tweet: Positive elements like awarding an actress make me think it's good news, so a positive factor.
Second tweet: The QTRRF stock ticker is something investors are probably checking for earnings or other news related to Quanterra Resources Inc.
Third tweet: Similar to the second, maybe about another company VNTV.
Fourth tweet: Positive ratings update from investment analysts could be good or bad.

Next, evaluating each tweet's factors:

First: Positive (actress award)
Second: Unknown, but stock ticker
Third: Unknown
Fourth: Positive (ratings)

Sentiment summary:
- First tweet is definitely positive.
- Second and third tweets are unclear because of the unknown stocks.
- Fourth tweet's sentiment depends on whether the ratings go up or not.

So overall, there are two clear positives and one ambiguous. If I consider that a company's stock price can be influenced by multiple factors but only some are known. It might be neutral because without more info, we don't know if it will go up or down."

2015-10-12,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price of some company. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying.

First tweet: ""merck also down 2 % in wake of lilly decision to scrap evacetrapib but regeneron up 2.5 % URL $ mrk $ lly $ regn"". So, Merck is down because they decided to scrap something called evacetrapib, which I think was related to chemotherapy, maybe a drug used for cancer treatment. But Regeneron's stock goes up by 2.5%. That means even though Merck went down, Regeneron went up. Hmm, not sure how that affects the overall market or company performance yet.

Second tweet: ""leahanne : volume alert - mrk 50.23 merck & company $ mrk hit URL"". This seems like a positive sign because leahanne is Alerting about volume and mentions MRK. Volume can indicate investor interest, so this might mean good news for the stock.

Third tweet: ""$ mrk - premarket biotech digest : understanding multiple sclerosis , gilead's hep c sales , astrazeneca halts URL"". This looks like a press release or announcement from Biogen. They're talking about understanding multiple sclerosis, Gilead's sales of Hep C, and Astrazeneca stopping their operations. If the company has positive news, especially regarding a new drug (Hep C), it could boost MRK.

So combining these, Merck is affected by regulatory changes, but Regeneron is doing well. Leahanne is saying volumes are up, which might be good for MRK. The Biogen announcement looks positive as well. Maybe overall, despite some negative news on MRK, the positives from other companies and the potential volume boost could balance it out.

I'm leaning towards a neutral stance because while there's some positive info about Biogen and multiple sectors, the main issue with Merck is regulatory stuff which might be temporary or just a one-off. The rest seems more like updates that investors can digest."

2015-10-14,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets about a company and figure out their impact on the stock price. The user provided two tweets, and they want me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative, then decide the overall effect.

First, let's look at the first tweet: ""after 3,500 % gains , we have a massive new penny stock pick coming monday ! special update : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"". The keyword here is ""url breakout"", which sounds like it could lead to an update or something related. Maybe they're introducing a new investment opportunity with a URL code. If this happens on Monday, that's likely a big move either up or down. I'm leaning towards a positive because companies usually announce significant news after the earnings report.

Next, the second tweet: ""mrk top news - oct 14th , 2015 $ mrk url"". This seems more specific about an event on October 14th, 2015. The mention of the stock MRK (maybe Microsoft) and a URL suggests they're announcing something important, possibly a deal or earnings report. Since it's from 2015, which is earlier than 2016, and if they announce something significant around that time, it could affect the market sentiment. I'm not sure yet; maybe it's neutral.

Considering both tweets together: The first one might push the stock higher, while the second could have a mixed effect based on when they're announced and what the event is about. Since neither tweet explicitly says ""up"" or ""down,"" but the first one seems positive and significant, even if the second is speculative, I think the overall sentiment is leaning towards positive because it's presenting a potential breakthrough in the company's product or market position."
2015-10-15,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of Mrk. First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: abcd cambium learning group inc . stock forum URL $ abcd $ mrk $ trq $ mrk abcd pennystocks stocks. Hmm, that looks like Mrk is mentioned twice as mrk. So the target stock is MRK.

Next, I need to break down each tweet into factors and assess their impact. 

In tweet 1, there's a lot of URL references and mentions of other companies. The first part mentions ""mrk $ trq $ mrk abcd pennystocks stocks,"" which seems like the main focus is on MRK. Then it jumps to ""abctw $ mrk $ p / e ratio..."" So that's another mention of Mrk with the P/E ratio, which could affect investor sentiment.

In tweet 2, there are more details about Facebook and other companies, but again, focusing on the target stock isMRK. The text mentions EOD data, which might relate to financial reports or earnings. It also talks about NASDAQfcel fuelcell energy, which I'm not sure how relevant that is for MRK.

I need to assess each tweet's factors and sentiment towards MRK. From the first tweet, there are multiple mentions of MRK with stock prices and other related companies. This could be a positive sign as it might indicate confidence in MRK. The P/E ratio mentioned could also be seen as favorable if it's lower than market expectations.

In the second tweet, mentioning Facebook and NASDAQfcel doesn't directly relate to MRK, but perhaps there's some context or mention of other sectors that might indirectly affect MRK's performance. However, this seems less likely to significantly impact MRK's stock price compared to the first tweet.

Considering both tweets together, the first one is more substantial and mentions multiple factors related to MRK, suggesting a positive outlook. The second tweet adds some information about broader financial markets but doesn't provide much specific to MRK. 

I should weigh these two tweets. Since the first one provides a lot of direct info about MRK, it's likely to have a stronger impact on the stock price compared to the second tweet. However, I also need to consider if there are any hidden factors or context that could be influencing the sentiment.

Wait, in the output requirements, each tweet is separate. So tweet 1 is one factor and tweet 2 is another. The overall sentiment should combine both tweets. Since both mention MRK with stock prices (abctw $ mrk), which typically indicates a positive environment for the stock. Even though the P/E ratio is mentioned in tweet 1, it's unclear if that significantly affects the price.

I think the primary impact comes from the multiple mentions of MRK and its associated stocks, leading to a positive sentiment. So overall, the sentiment should be positive."
2015-10-16,Positive,"Okay, let's analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for ""mrk"". 

First, I'll look at the target stock symbol in both tweets, which is ""mrk"".

Now, examining each tweet separately:

1. The first tweet mentions that Jan settling in mid-stage studies of a short-term combo medical device for HCV with an infection URL pre-market. It also provides prices like $jnj$, $achn$, $gild$, and $mrk$. This is all about stock performance metrics, which are crucial because they indicate how well the company is doing.

2. The second tweet says that our stock alerts have been seeing record gains and mentions a new pick for massive: URLs are $mrk$ and $lgnd$. Again, this is highlighting positive news regarding the stock's performance.

Next, I'll break down each tweet to identify factors and sentiment:

- For the first tweet:
  - **Positive Factors:** The mention of stock prices, particularly $mrk$, which likely affects investor sentiment positively.
  - **Negative Factors:** No negative elements in this tweet.

- For the second tweet:
  - **Positive Factors:** Again, positive mentions of gains and a new pick for a massive stock. This reinforces investor confidence that the stock is performing well.

Combining these factors from both tweets, it's clear that there are multiple positive indicators about mrk, including its current price levels and potential future performance based on previous trends.

Now, considering market sentiment, the consistent use of words like ""pre-market"" and ""record gains"" suggest anticipation and confidence in the stock. Investors likely expect strong growth, which adds to a positive outlook.

Putting it all together, with both tweets highlighting positive metrics and upcoming gains, this should lead to an overall positive sentiment."

2015-10-20,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price. So first, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""our pick on $ gequ multiplied more than 35 times it's value since the initial alert ! big news : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"". Hmm, that sounds like it could be related to Geq or MRSK, maybe even ESG because of the $ insy and $ mrk. 

The tweet mentions ""multiplied more than 35 times"" which seems like a huge increase. Also, it talks about URL breaks and things like $ insy and $ mrk, which are probably symbols for companies. The mention of ESG could be relevant if the company is involved in environmental, social, and governance aspects.

So with that information, I think Geq or MRSK might be the target stock. Then there's a second tweet: ""Geq has continued to grow steadily despite some challenges in the market. The company is leveraging innovative strategies to maintain its competitive edge."" 

This one seems more about the current performance of Geq. It mentions steady growth and managing challenges, which is positive. But it doesn't specify how much it's multiplied or any specific new information. Maybe not enough data for a clear sentiment.

Putting both together, the first tweet gives some big news with a lot of emphasis on Geq, implying strong potential. The second tweet is about the company's current performance but doesn't provide enough info to assess sentiment. So overall, it seems like there's some positive news pointing towards a favorable outlook, but not enough detail for an exact conclusion."
2015-10-21,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price for Merck. The user provided two tweets, and I need to analyze them step by step.

First, I remember that when analyzing financial news or tweets about stocks, it's important to identify specific components: target stock symbol, positive factors, negative factors, and then assess the overall sentiment towards the stock. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""merck & co . assigned “ aa ” credit rating $ mrk url acn"". Hmm, okay, so they're assigning a new credit rating for Merck. I know that credit ratings can affect investor sentiment because lower credit ratings might lead to more defaults or increased risk. But wait, if Merck is increasing their credit rating from something like ""a"" to ""aa"", does that mean the company is getting better financially? Maybe this could improve expectations of future performance.

Now, for the second tweet: ""merck & co . assigned “ aa ” credit rating $ mrk url acn"". Wait a minute, isn't that the same tweet as the first one? It seems like it's just repeating the same information. So maybe both tweets are referring to the same update from Merck.

I should check if I'm misunderstanding anything here. The user provided two identical tweets with the same content, so perhaps each is a separate update on the same subject. 

So, considering these two tweets, they're both about Merck increasing their credit rating to ""aa"". Since credit ratings can signal changes in the company's financial health and potential risks, this might indicate an improvement. If investors expect better credit ratings, they might see more positive news, which could be good for the stock price.

But wait, sometimes when a company receives a lower credit rating, it's not necessarily a bad thing if there are improvements or changes in their capital structure. However, a significant increase can lead to concerns about sustainability and financial stability. 

In this case, since the user hasn't provided any additional context about Merck's future performance, I might have to consider that an improved credit rating could be seen as positive by investors, leading them to buy more shares or feel confident in their stock position.

But let me think again: does assigning a lower credit rating (from ""a"" to ""aa"") indicate better or worse for the company? An ""a"" usually is a low credit rating, suggesting lower risk but also higher risk. An ""aa"" is an even more favorable rating, indicating less risk and possibly stronger financial position. So, if Merck assigns a new rating, it could mean that they're seeing improvements in their creditworthiness.

Therefore, this positive change might lead investors to feel more secure about the stock, which would translate into a positive overall sentiment for the company's stock price."
2015-10-22,Missing,File not found
2015-10-23,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The possible sentiments are positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions ""pcln URL inc."" which doesn't sound like it's related to any specific company, so maybe that's just a typo or irrelevant. Then it talks about investor opinions and specific stocks like $pcln $ skx $ mrk $ titxf. I'm not sure what these symbols mean, but they might be abbreviations for stock tickers. It seems focused on several companies, which could influence investor sentiment if there's information that affects their performance.

Tweet 2 is about Merck & Co. releasing earnings on Tuesday. This is a significant news event because earnings are crucial for investors. I remember that when companies release earnings reports, they often announce future stock prices or buybacks. So this tweet seems to be positive because it could signal good news and potentially increase stock price.

Tweet 3 mentions ""impllications for gilead of the problems with abbvie."" Again, I'm not sure what these abbreviations mean, but there's a mention of Gilead and Abvaite. The fact that this tweet is about issues with another company might be negative if it's suggesting potential risks or problems ahead, which could lower investor confidence.

Now, combining these thoughts: Tweet 2 is definitely positive because earnings are a big deal. Tweets 1 and 3 don't give clear information about the company or its operations, so their impact isn't as certain. But overall, the most prominent positive factor seems to be tweet 2 with the earnings report."
2015-10-24,Missing,File not found
2015-10-25,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company called MRK. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet is ""rt URL $ mrk - buy signal at 52.01 on oct 22 , 15 by URL trading signals robot stock trading tra…"". Hmm, this seems like an offer to buy the stock at a specific price on a certain date. It mentions ""buy signal,"" so it's indicating that someone thinks buying now might be beneficial or perhaps they're selling their shares. The tweet is pretty direct and offers action, which could be seen as both positive and negative depending on context. 

The second tweet is ""Selling shares at $150 a share."" This seems more serious and indicates a desire to sell the stock rather than buy it. Selling actions can have significant impacts on stock prices because selling reduces ownership, but it also depends on why someone would sell. It's important not just to take it at face value but also consider external factors like market conditions.

Now, considering both tweets together: The first is about buying shares, which could suggest a positive outlook if the user thinks the stock is undervalued or expected to rise. However, selling shares implies that the user may be cautious and concerned about any potential losses. So, this seems contradictory—buying when you're thinking to sell.

Putting it all together, while one tweet suggests buying at a specific price, another indicates selling, which could counteract each other. It's unclear without more context whether these actions are intended or if they're just taking positions on the market. In the absence of additional information, it's hard to assess the overall impact. The options provided are [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Without clear indication of sentiment beyond what's stated, I might lean towards aneutral stance because each tweet provides conflicting signals.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. If one tweet suggests buying and another selling, perhaps it's about maintaining a balanced position rather than taking on both sides. But in the given examples earlier, such contradictory tweets were considered neutral when they were just positions without sentiment analysis. So perhaps this is also neutral because each statement isn't indicating a positive or negative overall direction but is instead presenting two different actions."
2015-10-26,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user has provided three tweets, each with some symbols, and I need to decide if they are positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER oh hey guys . remember these other drug companies $ mrk $ pfe $ bmy $ gild ? they all report earnings tomorrow ."" This seems like a reminder for investors that several companies will be releasing financial reports. It's just an announcement and doesn't seem to mention any positive or negative aspects towards the company in question, which I'm assuming is related since AT_USER is probably a stock.

Next, tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER top upcoming earnings $ baba $ f $ jblu $ ups $ pfe bp $ glw $ save $ cmcsa $ grub $ coh $ mrk $ cake URL URL."" This tweet mentions several symbols and includes words like ""ups"" and ""cake,"" which might imply that the company is doing well or is experiencing some positive news. The mention of upcoming earnings could indicate optimism among investors, leading to a positive sentiment.

Now, tweet 3: ""$ brcm $ mrk : game plan for the week – cramer ’ s mad money ( 10/23 / 15 ): URL."" This looks like a call for action. It seems like Mrk is planning something significant in their operations or maybe preparing for an event, which could be positive if it's related to growth and expected by investors.

Putting it all together: The first tweet provides general information without specific info on the company. The second and third tweets offer positive outlooks, including mentions of earnings and future plans. These signals are typically good indicators of positive sentiment towards a stock because they attract attention and show confidence in the company's prospects."
2015-10-27,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price. Let's go step by step.

First, from the target stock symbol, it seems like the user is mentioning stocks related to pharmaceuticals and biotech because of mentions of pharma and bmy. That might indicate a focus on a tech or biotech company in that sector.

Looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet talks about $bmy$ and other indices beating estimates. That's positive because it shows actual performance exceeding expectations, which usually boosts stock prices.
2. The second tweet mentions Merck's quarterly earnings, which are positive metrics. This suggests good financial performance, supporting the stock positively.
3. Third tweet discusses sales numbers for Anti-PD and Bmy, with Bmy selling 305M beats 238M consensus. Positive sales figures would be a good sign.
4. Fourth tweet compares EPS for both PFE and BMY across the board. PFE's EPS is higher than PFE's target, which might indicate the stock is improving or performing better.
5. Fifth tweet discusses drugs being in the early stages but emphasizing the industry's potential. This is generally positive as it signals growth and improvement.
6. The sixth tweet talks about holdings and stock prices for a financial company, which isn't directly related to the target stocks mentioned before.

Now, combining all these, each tweet seems to highlight positive aspects of PFE or BMY. For example, sales numbers beating estimates in 3 and 4, quarter earnings in 2, and growth in the industry in 5. These are all good indicators that might push the stock positively. The fifth tweet is a bit vague but mentions potential, which could indicate future strength.

I don't see any negative or neutral signals here because all points seem to contribute to a positive outlook on these stocks."
2015-10-28,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of dh.to $ dh corp. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I should figure out what each tweet is about. The target stock symbol seems to be dh.to $ dh corp., which might refer to a specific company in the financial sector. 

Looking at tweet 1: ""dh.to dh corp . chart URL $ dh.to $ mru.to $ mrk $ cvs dh.to tradeideas pennystocks"". This one looks like it's setting up some URLs and mentions other stocks, maybe related to dh.com or similar. It doesn't seem positive; it might be about introducing the company or providing links. That could mean a positive signal for growth, so I'm leaning towards [Positive].

Tweet 2: ""sentishiftup $ plug $ lqd $ pg $ rwm $ mrk fintech finserv URL 2015102 8-14 : 00"". The mention of fintech and finserv makes me think about technology companies, especially in the fintech space. Sentiment here is more negative because I don't see any positive indicators like good news or expected earnings. So this tweet might be a bit of a head-scratcher but could indicate some instability in the tech sector.

Tweet 3: ""$ mrk impressive recovery on + ve momentum breaking out the 50ma to reach the weekly line $ 55.14 AT_USER URL"". This one clearly mentions ""impressive recovery"" and mentions ""AT_USER,"" which might mean analytics or user engagement, though I'm not sure about that part. The 50ma reaching a significant line suggests some positive momentum. However, since it's from mrk, which is likely dh.com, this could be an indicator of growth in their performance. But the mention of ""impressive recovery"" and breaking out of a line might also suggest that there are underlying positive factors.

Now, putting it all together: tweet 1 could be positive for the company, but tweet 2 introduces a negative environment, and tweet 3 shows potential growth. However, given that the overall impact is based on multiple tweets, I think the strongest signals here point towards a positive overall sentiment because even though one tweet is negative, the others are positive or mixed. The mention of fintech in tweet 2 could be a red flag for investors, but maybe they're signaling some cautious approach due to potential risks. So combining these factors, I'm leaning toward [Positive] as the overall sentiment."
2015-10-29,Negative,"Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze tweets about stock prices and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for a given company. They provided two tweets related to Merck & Co.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""mrk : insider selling : merck & co . director peter c . wendell sells 5000 … : URL"". The key part here is ""mrk"", which stands for Merck & Co., so that's our stock.

Next, I'll analyze each tweet one by one. 

The first tweet mentions an insider selling 5000 shares of Merck. Selling insider might indicate a negative sentiment because it can signal strategic decisions that could impact the company's performance or future prospects. However, I should consider other factors like market conditions and if the seller has any intentions beyond just selling.

The second tweet says ""new insider transaction on mrk reported a moment ago : url"". Similar to the first, this suggests another insider action, which again might indicate concern about strategic moves.

Now, combining these two tweets. Both mention insider transactions, which typically can be seen as negative by investors because it raises questions about their motives or actions that could affect the stock. But I should also think about whether they're positive in context—maybe some insider selling indicates a focus on increasing shares, but without more details, it's hard to say.

Since both tweets are from the same company and involve insider transactions, they likely provide context for negative sentiment. However, sometimes insider buying can indicate ownership or influence, which could be mixed. But considering the information given, both actions are related toMerck and are selling shares, which is a clear sell-off move that would typically be negative.

I think it's more about the information released than intent. They just sold 5000 shares, so it's not clear if they were buying or selling. Without knowing their intention beyond selling, I can't confirm it's positive. So overall sentiment seems negative."
2015-10-30,Missing,File not found
2015-10-31,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of Merck. First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at both tweets, the only relevant one is ""mrk - URL URL"", so the stock symbol must be MRK.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and break them down into factors—Positive (P) or Negative (N). 

The first tweet says: ""merck is trading at a discount of 24.0 % mrk - URL URL"". This clearly states that Merck's stock is trading below its price, which suggests an overvalued position for the stock.

The second tweet reads: ""rt crayton_h oh hey no biggie just an interview with merck's ceo about $ 150,000 drug prices by cynthialkoons URL $ mrk"". This seems to mention an interview with a CEOs talking about drug prices and mentions the company symbol. It's more of a commentary on current events without expressing strong positive or negative sentiment towards Merck.

Now, I'll assess each tweet's impact. The first one clearly shows a discount, which is a negative indicator for investors who expect the stock to rise. The second tweet has a mix of topics and mentions but doesn't present any strong sentiment about the company itself. It's more about an event or discussion rather than a recommendation.

Combining these factors, even though the second tweet adds some context, it's not enough to outweigh the clear discount in the first tweet. So the overall sentiment is negative."
2015-11-01,Missing,File not found
2015-11-02,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets are likely to impact the stock price of a company. The target tweet is ""rt AT_USER $ mrk receives breakthrough therapy designation for keytruda in advanced colorectal cancer"". Okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweet, it mentions Keytruda, which is often abbreviated as KTC or KTR. So I'm assuming the stock symbol is either AT_USER $ mrk (if that's a typo for Keytruda's ticker symbol) or maybe another symbol. Wait, keytruda.com might have a different ticker, but sometimes they use symbols like MRK for Marvel or another company. Hmm, this could be confusing.

Wait, no, the tweet says ""mrk receives breakthrough therapy designation for keytruda in advanced colorectal cancer"". So it's referring to Keytruda stock being recognized by the therapy program mrk. That makes sense because many drugs are listed with their respective stock symbols. So perhaps the target is Keytruda (KTC), and $ mrk is not an official symbol but just part of the text.

Next, I'll separate each tweet into positive and negative factors. The tweet only has one relevant tweet, so I can analyze all its components as a single factor. Now, I need to assess the sentiment of this tweet towards Keytruda stock.

The tweet mentions that $ mrk receives a breakthrough designation for keytruda in advanced colorectal cancer. That seems positive because it's recognizing the drug with a new treatment. It could imply that keytruda is now being recognized by regulatory bodies, which might lead to increased approval or acceptance. Higher recognition usually means more investment and potentially better stock performance.

Considering all this, the tweet supports Keytruda's future stock price positively. The company is getting a breakthrough in their treatment for a serious disease, so investors are likely supportive. Therefore, the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-11-03,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user has given me a set of tweets and wants me to determine their impact on a stock's future price. They also provided an example output which is ""[Negative]"", so I need to follow that pattern.

First, the target stock symbol isn't specified here. But from the tweet, it seems like they're talking about ""mrk"", which might be MRC or Marvel, since those are known companies. I'll have to assume it's a major tech company as these tweets seem positive in general.

Looking at each tweet: The first one says ""rt URL $ mrk received a new alert . find out why at URL stocks daytrading trading mkt nyse n …"". It seems to be addressing the user, mentioning a warning. That makes me think there's some concern about the stock. It doesn't look like a positive or neutral message; it sounds negative because of that warning.

So the overall sentiment from this tweet is likely Negative."
2015-11-04,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets about stock prices for XOM, MRK, and EMR. Let me start by identifying the target stock each tweet refers to.

The first tweet mentions several companies like XOM, MRK, and EMR with their stock symbols. That means all these stocks could be impacting the overall sentiment. The second tweet is about creating a portfolio, which doesn't directly mention any of these stocks, so it's probably not relevant unless I missed something.

Next, I'll break down each tweet to find positive and negative factors. For the first tweet:

Positive factors:
- XOM: Positive for growth potential.
- MRK: Strong financial performance.
- EMR: Potential as a renewable energy company.

Negative factors:
- Overall tech focus might affect other companies but not directly these ones mentioned.

Looking at the second tweet, there's no mention of any stock symbols or topics related to these specific stocks. It's more about building a portfolio and doesn't provide sentiment data for XOM, MRK, or EMR.

Now, I'll assess each tweet's impact on investor sentiment:

First tweet is a general business analysis with vague directions but mentions some high-facing companies. It might not have strong positive or negative vibes yet. The second tweet seems neutral since it's about portfolio building without discussing stock performance.

Combining these thoughts, the overall sentiment isn't clear yet. Both tweets are providing information that could influence investor expectations but don't present a decisive positive or negative outlook on any of the mentioned stocks. Therefore, I should conclude with a Neutral sentiment."
2015-11-05,Neutral,"Alright, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price impact. The user provided three tweets and wants me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative regarding a company's future stock price.

First, I'll extract the stock symbols from each tweet to identify the target stock. 

1. The first tweet mentions ""hpv vaccines not linked to chronic pain or fainting."" This sounds like it could relate to a healthcare company, possibly related to pharma (pharmaceuticals). So, maybe it's about Merck (MRK), which is a major pharmaceutical company.
2. The second tweet starts with ""$ gild $ vrtx for a 26-year-old company that’s only had one profitable year."" I'm not entirely sure what ""gild"" and ""vrtx"" stand for, but it seems like they're referring to a company called AbbVie (ABBV), which is also in the healthcare industry.
3. The third tweet says ""merck & co. director wendell p . weeks sells 5,000 shares $ mrk."" This clearly mentions Merck (MRK) as the company and refers to a director selling shares.

So, all three tweets are about Merck or AbbVie. Both companies are in the healthcare sector, which is generally stable but can be influenced by various factors.

Now, I'll analyze each tweet individually focusing on positive or negative factors affecting investor sentiment.

1. The first tweet talks about the effectiveness of hpv vaccines and doesn't mention any health issues related to pain or fainting. It says it's approved by European regulators. This could indicate that the company is focusing on research rather than product development, which might be seen as a positive because it shows they're prioritizing future products.
2. The second tweet starts with $ gild and mentions AbbVie having only one profitable year. I'm not sure about AbbVie's current performance but this could mean that the company is struggling or in a tough economic environment, which might lead to negative sentiment.
3. The third tweet clearly states that Merck director sells shares of their stock. This can be interpreted as insider information or a strategic move, which typically signals positive news for investors.

Now, combining these observations: two tweets (1 and 2) are more about the company's operations and financial health, while the third is more about an internal matter. It seems like the director selling shares could indicate increased investor interest or insider information, but it might also depend on whether it's a positive move.

Looking at factors:
- The first tweet suggests focused research and development, which can be seen as positive.
- The second tweet indicates financial challenges, possibly negative.
- The third tweet is about insider trading, which is generally considered positive because it can signal strategic moves.

Considering these, I think the overall sentiment is a mix of positive (from the director's actions) and slightly negative due to AbbVie's performance. But given that the other tweets are more on the surface operations, maybe the dominant factor is the director's action, making it positive. However, without knowing AbbVie's current situation, it's hard to say definitively.

I'm leaning towards a mix of both factors, but since one tweet is about research and another about financials, I might consider that as neutral because they are on opposing ends. The director's action could be pushing the positive side, but the financial stress (second tweet) could push it negative. But wait, if all tweets are pointing towards Merck or AbbVie being in a tough spot but there's also focus on research, maybe overall sentiment is leaning positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the dominant factor is the director selling shares because that's more about insider information than financial performance. So the sentiment might be positive due to the move, despite some negative signals elsewhere.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a neutral stance since there are conflicting elements but with significant positive moves."
2015-11-06,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on the stock price of Mrk. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, each starts with ""rt AT_USER sugammadex clin..."" which mentions sugammadex, so I think the company in question is sugammadex.

Now, let's go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says: ""Has $ mrk presented sufficient info to characterize risk of hypersensitivity / anaphylaxis risk …"" So, it's talking about Mrk presenting information that helps understand risk related to hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis are conditions where a person becomes sensitive or may react suddenly to something. But since the tweet is from sugammadex, I'm not sure what they're saying specifically. It seems like it's about public info affecting their risk assessment, but I can't tell if that's positive, negative, or neutral.

2. The second tweet mentions ""clinc & post-market experience $ mrk : c'mon , it's approved in 57 countries ( they didn't actually say this ) URL."" So, sugammadex is talking about their drug approval status after the market ended. They're checking if the product was approved globally and mention that they didn't actually say something. This seems like a positive sign because it's showing approval, which could lower costs and reduce risk. However, since the user didn't specify, I'm not sure if this is a clear positive or more of a general outlook.

3. The third tweet says: ""$ mrk - lilly , merck receive inquiries from justice dept . over drug pricing URL."" This suggests that sugammadex is receiving inquiries from the justice department regarding drug pricing. The justice department often deals with legal matters, so this could mean they're concerned about regulations or legal issues in drug pricing. But since it's a bit vague and not directly related to stock performance, I'm uncertain about the sentiment here.

Now, compiling these thoughts:

- Tweet 1: Not sure if they have enough info on risk.
- Tweet 2: Positive because of approval status, but not certain.
- Tweet 3: Vague, so unclear sentiment.

I don't see any clear trends in positive or negative sentiment. The first tweet is somewhat neutral about the risk aspect, and the others are too vague for a clear assessment. So maybe the overall sentiment is [Neutral]."
2015-11-07,Positive,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets about an investment stock called Excel. The first tweet just lists some prices and mentions Excel as "" investingxlp,"" which seems like it's promoting Excel for investment purposes. It uses words like ""investing"" and ""select sector,"" so that gives me a hint of potential focus on Excel.

The second tweet is shorter, but it says ""mrk $ lc $ mcd xlk."" I know that Mrk is a technology stock related to Microsoft or something similar, while Lc and Mcd could refer to other stocks. This seems like a quick mention without any positive or negative keywords, so the sentiment might not be clear here.

The rest of the tweets are all focused on Excel again. They're all about Excel's performance in different sectors and market movements. Excel is known for being a big tech company, especially in the consumer staples segment, which seems to align with Excel's usual focus areas. Each tweet adds more details about how Excel has been performing relative to others or the overall market.

So putting it together, all these tweets are reinforcing that Excel might be a good investment. They're highlighting its growth potential and positive performance trends across various sectors and times of the year. The repeated mentions of Excel in these tweets suggest consistent information, which is favorable for sentiment analysis.

Considering the context where such information is given, especially if it's promoting Excel as an investment, there's likely a strong underlying positive sentiment driving these tweets. Investors might be feeling optimistic about its potential future performance or upcoming earnings, which would make this content more attractive than negative or neutral."
2015-11-08,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and decide their impact on stock prices for the given company. So, the user has provided a tweet: ""$ mrk lilly , merck receive inquiries from justice dept . over drug pricing - - 2nd update ( URL"". 

First off, I need to identify the target stock. The tweet mentions ""mrk lilly , merck"" and ""drug pricing."" Hmm, that seems like it could be referring to Merck & Co., which is a well-known pharmaceutical company. So, my target stock is Merck. Now, looking at the rest of the tweet: it's from justice dept., so I'm guessing they're from the U.S. Department of Justice. The mention of inquiries and updates on drug pricing seems positive because drug pricing issues can affect a company's profitability.

Now, breaking down each factor in the tweet:

1. ""$ mrk lilly , merck receive inquiries from justice dept . over drug pricing"" – This clearly indicates that Merck is receiving updates about drug pricing, which could be good news if it leads to better pricing strategies or regulations. The ""2nd update ( URL"" part might link to more information, but the main point seems to be the inquiry.

Next, considering factors:

Positive Factors: The tweet suggests that Merck is responding to important issues related to drug pricing, which is positive for investors looking to stay ahead of regulatory changes and potential price adjustments. It's like showing a proactive approach, so that could improve investor sentiment.

Negative Factors: I don't immediately spot any negative aspects here. Unless there's some hidden information, but the tweet doesn't mention anything bad or problematic.

Now, assessing the impact on stock price:

Positive Sentiment is indicated because the company is addressing drug pricing issues, which can directly influence their financial performance. The customer service and response from justice dept. might help in getting better pricing, leading to more stable earnings and potentially higher stock prices. The positive outlook aligns with this.

So, considering all these factors—positive inquiries and updates on drug pricing—I think the overall sentiment is positive for Merck. That would likely lead to a ""[Positive]"" rating."

2015-11-11,Positive,"Alright, let's break down how I approached analyzing the tweets for their impact on stock price.

First, I started by identifying the target stock symbol. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions ""mrk,"" which is Tesla's ticker symbol. That makes sense because Tesla has been a significant player in the renewable energy sector and biotech innovations, especially with their recent FDA approval deal.

Next, I looked at each tweet to separate positive (P) and negative (N) factors. The tweet talks about potential approvals to watch before the end of the year, which is relevant for investors concerned with a company's performance as it approaches a strategic time frame. This indicates a positive outlook.

However, the next line mentions ""url mrk,"" but that seems like an error since I know Tesla's stock symbol is ""mrk."" Maybe this was a typo or a placeholder. It probably doesn't impact the overall sentiment negatively because it might just be a random link to avoid the user identifying themselves.

Putting this together, the tweet highlights their interest in future approvals, which adds weight to the company's prospects. Since there are no negative factors mentioned and the positive factor is clear, the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-11-12,Negative,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock prices. First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet because they all have something like $ mrk.de or similar. Looking at them, it seems everyone is talking about $ mrk.de. So that's my target stock.

Next, for each tweet, I have to identify positive and negative factors. Let me go through them one by one.

The first tweet says: ""$ . ftse $ . gdaxi $ . fchi $ mrk $ vgk $ iev $ ewg $ uk $ ewq : europe seen lower as oil price slides : URL"". Hmm, this one seems a bit confusing with some dollar symbols that might be URLs or just random characters. It mentions Europe being lower because of oil price slides. I'm not sure about the specifics here, but if the oil prices are going up and Europe's stock is down, that could affect GM (since $ mrk.de likely refers to GM). But without more context, it's hard to assess the sentiment.

The second tweet: ""$ mrk.de sharesdownperc.at $ : shares of gilead sciences have dropped 0.8 % to $ 106.44 newssentiment URL"". This clearly states that Gilead Sciences' shares have dropped by 0.8% and are now trading at $106.44. That's a significant drop in stock price, so the sentiment is Negative.

The third tweet: ""merck kgaa : invest securities reste à ' achat ' . URL $ mrk"". It looks like M&G (merck KG) is about to remain 'achat' or something, which might indicate instability. But there's no direct mention of stock price changes here. So I'm not sure if this affects the sentiment. Maybe the tweet is just indicating uncertainty but doesn't provide a clear positive or negative outcome.

Now, combining these thoughts: The second tweet clearly shows a drop in stock price by 0.8%, which is a strong negative signal. Even though the other two tweets are unclear on their impact, one of them (the third) mentions something about M&G's stability but doesn't give enough info to influence sentiment.

So, weighing it all, there's definitely a Negative sentiment because of the significant drop in Gilead Sciences' shares."
2015-11-13,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, the user wants me to analyze some tweets and determine if they'll impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for a given company. 

First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The task is to take each tweet, identify the target stock symbol, break it down into positive and negative factors, assess the sentiment, and then summarize the overall sentiment across all relevant tweets.

Looking at the provided tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions Merck reiterating dedication to animal health with Harrismatics' acquisition. It's a positive statement about Merck's commitment to animal health. 

2. The second tweet lists several filing-related stocks: Lulu, Macy's, Sphs, and GEs. Filing activities often indicate strategic decisions that can affect the stock price positively or negatively depending on the context. Since it mentions a nasdaq tradeideas scenario, it's likely providing information about future trading ideas but not explicitly stated to be positive or negative.

3. The third tweet talks about Merck's cardio study rolling in as rivals pile up. This suggests that Merck is involved in a competitive area, which might influence its stock price positively if the outcome is good. However, it could also indicate uncertainty due to rising competition, though not necessarily a guarantee of positive impact.

4. The fourth tweet mentions a question about whether Gilead Sciences or Abbvie will win treatment for hepatitis C in 2016. This seems like a specific, yes/no question that could affect Merck's stock price if the answer is positive or negative. However, without knowing the outcome, it's hard to assess sentiment.

5. The fifth tweet talks about Merck's healthcare dynamics being weak and mentions GSK as a competitor. This again suggests that Merck might face competition, which could be either positive (if new strategies emerge) or negative (if seen as a weaker player). 

Now, considering all these tweets, each provides information that could influence the stock price. The first tweet is clearly positive about Merck's commitment. The third and fifth tweets suggest strategic moves by Merck against competitors, which adds to their credibility. The fourth tweet introduces an uncertain factor (the hepatitis C treatment question) but doesn't specify a direction for that outcome.

However, none of these tweets are specific enough to predict a clear positive or negative trend. They mainly provide context about Merck's activities and strategic moves. Without more detailed information on the potential results of these discussions, it's challenging to determine whether they will impact the stock price positively or neutrally. 

So, after analyzing all the factors provided, it seems there's no strong enough positive sentiment to outweigh any negative points. Therefore, the overall sentiment is neutral."

2015-11-16,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet says: ""after 3,500 % gains in 4 months we have a new stock pick coming tomorrow ! check it out : URL breakout $ insy $ mrk"". The user is encouraging them to check out a stock called Insy and Mrk. They're expecting more gains in the next four months. I'm not sure about the percentage, but they're planning ahead and making an informed decision. That sounds like positive sentiment because they're looking for action.

The second tweet: ""pgh pengrowth energy corp . short sales URL $ pgh $ ugaz $ td.to $ mrk pgh nasdaq stockmarket"". This seems to mention short sales from Pengrowth Energy, which is a financial activity. Short selling is a trading strategy where investors sell stocks they believe will rise in price. However, the sentiment isn't clear here because it's unclear whether short selling would be positive or negative for the company. It could lead to higher stock prices if the short positions are managed well.

The third tweet: ""dow stocks trend $ dd $ ge $ dis $ gs $ v $ jpm $ jnj $ mmm $ msft $ trv $ utx $ mrk $ ko $ xom $ pg $ ba $ intc $ mcd $ cvx $ csco @ URL"". It's talking about Dow stocks and mentions several sectors like energy, technology, consumer discretionary. The mention of short sales again is here too. I'm not sure what the user is planning with these stocks. Without more context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative.

Putting it all together: The first tweet shows excitement and looking ahead, which could be positive. The other tweets are about short selling, which can cause stock prices to rise as investors take profits. So overall, the information suggests that the company might experience some positive actions, but there's uncertainty due to short selling."
2015-11-17,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. So, first, I need to determine what the target stock symbol is. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. The first tweet mentions ""hgd.to horizons betapro s & p / tsx global gold bear plus etf filings URL $ hgd.to $ spxs $ mrk $ nugt hgd.to stock stock."" Hmm, the last part includes ""mrk"", which I think stands for Merck. So maybe the target stock is Merck?

2. The second tweet says: ""merck : des données à venir dans l'immunothérapie . URL $ mrk."" This seems to be another mention of Merck, so perhaps it's also referring to Merck.

So the target stock symbol here is likely Merck (MRK). 

Next step is to analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors. The first tweet has multiple mentions like s&p, gold prices, etf filings, etc. These are all related to financial aspects of Merck. I know that the S&P 500 and gold prices can influence stock performance, especially in times of market stress.

The second tweet is more specific, mentioning Immunothérapie (which I believe is a field related to Merck's product development), but it doesn't explicitly state if it's positive or negative. However, the URL mentions $ mrk, which again refers to Merck. 

Now, considering how these factors might affect stock price:

1. The S&P 500 (SPX) is a broad market index. If it's bullish, it could make investors feel safer, but if it's bearish, they might worry about the economy.

2. Gold prices are related to the U.S. dollar and inflation. A bullish S&P might lead people to expect higher inflation or lower interest rates, which can affect gold demand. For example, high inflation makes gold more attractive because it holds value against strong currencies. Conversely, if gold is seen as a safe asset, its price might rise.

3. Etf filings (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment vehicles. If Merck's product portfolio improves, especially in areas like Immunothérapie, it could attract investors and boost the stock. However, this depends on how successful the Merck products are.

4. The mention of Merck could influence investor confidence. If Merck is in a good position with good financials or strong product development, it might increase demand for their shares, making them more attractive to investors.

Putting this together: The S&P 500 and gold prices are related to economic factors that can affect investor sentiment. High inflation expectations from the S&P might make people cautious about spending money in gold. Etf filings improving could indicate better opportunities in a sector Merck is involved with, which would boost their stock. However, without explicit info on gold price movements or specific financial performance, it's hard to gauge. But overall, the positive factors of economic data and potential product success seem to have a mixed effect.

Considering that Merck has strong financials (as indicated by the URL), their performance might positively impact their shares even if there are positive market signals. The tweet mentions Immunothérapie, which is a specific area related to medical treatments, so this could be seen as beneficial for investors in that sector.

However, I'm not entirely sure if all these factors play together to create a net effect. There's a mix of economic indicators and specific product developments, each potentially positive but also depending on broader market conditions.

In the end, while some positive elements are present, especially with Merck's financial health and potential positive outlook in their key product areas, the impact might still be neutral or slightly negative because other factors like geopolitical issues could come into play. But since these tweets don't mention anything that suggests uncertainty, it leans towards a slight positive.

I'm leaning towards ""[Positive]"" because of the company's strong fundamentals related to Merck and potential sector-specific success in Immunothérapie, though not entirely sure if market signals outweigh this."
2015-11-18,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Merck's stock price based on the given information. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""merck & co . given aa credit rating $ mrk url"". This seems like a news article that mentions Merck has been given an AA credit rating. Credit ratings can indicate how strong a company is in its industry. If Merck is rated AA, it's considered strong and stable. Companies with higher credit ratings tend to have lower stock prices because they're seen as safer investments.

Then the second tweet: ""after 3,500 % gains in 4 months we have a new stock pick coming tomorrow ! check it out : url stocks $ lgnd"". This seems more like a prediction or an offer. It mentions that if you wait for three months and see a 3,500% gain, they'll come with a new stock pick. That's pretty speculative. Stock picks usually have positive sentiment because companies are excited about new opportunities.

Now, I need to analyze the factors from each tweet. The first one is a news event affecting Merck's credit rating, which might lower their stock price because of increased risk. The second tweet is offering something, but it doesn't specify whether it'll go up or down; it just says ""after 3,500% gains..."" which could be seen as optimistic, leading to positive sentiment.

But wait, Merck's credit rating being AA might mean they're more stable, so a negative impact on the stock. The offering isn't clear, but if it's a pickup, maybe that supports a positive trend. However, the overall market can react unpredictably. I should consider both factors together.

Merck has a strong track record, and an AA rating could mean lower volatility. But the speculative offer might push the stock up. So combining these, the negative sentiment from the credit rating might offset the positive offer? Or maybe the offer is a lead-in to the credit rating? Hmm.

I think Merck's stock price would decrease because of the credit rating (negative factor), but the offering might increase it (positive factor). However, since Merck has been doing well historically, especially with a strong AA rating, which could mean more stability. But the timing of the offer is in three months, so immediate impact isn't clear.

I need to weigh these factors. The credit rating is a significant event that can influence stock price, and the offering is speculative. Considering Merck's history, I'd lean towards negative sentiment because an AA rating could lead to lower prices despite the speculation. So overall, it might be [Negative]."

2015-11-20,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The task is to determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying.

Looking at the first tweet: "" dozenstocks : dow stocks trend $ ko $ ba $ dis $ trv $ hd $ jnj $ v $ intc $ jpm $ pg $ mcd $ mrk $ msft $ utx $ ge $ aapl $ gs $ wm … URL""

Hmm, this seems like it's providing information about stock prices for multiple companies. It might be a list of stocks or perhaps some kind of market news. I'm not sure if each word represents a stock symbol or the name of something else.

Wait, ""dow stocks"" probably refers to Dow stocks, which is the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The rest seems like other financial terms or codes maybe. Since it's all in dollars and mentions several companies, perhaps it's a list of stock prices for various companies mentioned here.

Now, considering that these are likely market indices or individual company stock price updates, the impact would depend on how the prices have changed. But since I don't see any data on actual stock prices changing, maybe this tweet is just serving as informational content without any explicit positive or negative sentiment.

But wait, the user provided a list of words and a URL at the end. Maybe it's an incomplete URL for more information? If that's the case, perhaps it's not part of the tweets but part of the surrounding context. Without knowing the exact stock symbols or current price changes, I can't determine if this tweet affects the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively.

So, considering all this uncertainty, maybe I should consider each tweet independently. But without specific information about stock prices or trends, it's hard to assess. However, given that it seems like a list of stock-related terms, perhaps it doesn't provide any actionable information on stock performance, making the overall impact neutral.

Alternatively, if these tweets are part of a larger conversation where other factors have been discussed, maybe their collective impact is positive or negative based on those existing discussions. But without more context, I can't make an informed decision beyond what's stated here.

In conclusion, since the tweet provides information about stock prices for multiple companies but doesn't specify any particular trend or sentiment towards them, it seems neutral regarding the overall stock price impact."

2015-11-22,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about Merck stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the company's future stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet separately. The first one is ""merck & co valuation - november 2015 update $ mrk url"". This seems to be a news tweet from November 2015. I know that Merck has had significant financial events in 2015 that might affect its stock price, especially around their dividend payments and maybe their product launches or partnerships. But the exact content isn't provided, so it's a bit tricky.

The second tweet is ""investors buy merck & co . on weakness $ mrk url"". This sounds more recent, but I'm not sure about the specifics. It mentions that investors are buying Merck because they see a weakness in their stock price. But without knowing the exact cause of the weakness or the reasoning behind the buy, it's hard to assess the sentiment.

Wait, maybe I can use context. In November 2015, Merck had issues with their sales and profitability, which could affect their stock price. The first tweet seems to set the stage for a valuation update, so it might influence investor expectations. The second tweet is more specific about investors buying because of a perceived weakness.

I think I need to consider how each tweet impacts overall sentiment. The first tweet gives some context on valuation, which could make people more cautious or risk-averse, leading to a negative view if they expect the stock price to drop. The second tweet is a direct statement that investors are buying due to a potential weakness. If they see a weakness and buy, it might indicate positive sentiment towards selling more.

But I'm not entirely sure about the balance here. Maybe it's neutral because both tweets are providing some information but in different directions: one from context and one from an outright sell-off."

2015-11-24,Positive,"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether each tweet will positively affect, neutrally impact, or negatively impact the stock price of the company in question. The user provided three tweets and wants a summary using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from each tweet. It seems like the stocks involved are XOM (Microsoft), EMR (Eastman Group), TELUS, EFN (Element Financial), and Merck (MRK). These are known sectors in the financial and tech industries.

Let's go through each tweet one by one.

**1. Tweet 1: ""neither bull nor bear : a new paradigm URL $ x $ nflx $ emr $ jnj $ xom $ msft $ wmt $ mrk""**

The phrase ""a new paradigm URL"" doesn't provide clear information about the stock symbol, so I can't extract it. Without knowing the exact stock, it's hard to assess its impact. However, since it's a general statement without specific details, I might infer that it could be related to emerging trends or companies in these sectors, which are all positive signs for stock performance.

**2. Tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER top picks of bruce campbell AT_USER - telus $ t.to , element financial $ efn.to , and merck $ mrk . n""**

This tweet mentions that the user's top picks include BRU (Brucecampbell Soup), Telus, Element Financial, and Merck. All these companies are known in financial sectors. Positive words about investment picks suggest good company news, which could indicate positive sentiment towards these stocks.

**3. Tweet 3: ""replicate multimillionaire strategy easy to copy ! subscription is cheap ! URL .. breakout $ insy $ mrk""**

This tweet talks about a replication strategy for a multi-billionaire tech company that's easier to adopt and offers a quick break into the market with a subscription fee. This indicates a potential opportunity or announcement about entering a new market, which could be a sign of positive news.

**Overall Sentiment Summary:**

- Tweet 1: General positive statement.
- Tweets 2 and 3: Positive mentions of investments in companies across financial sectors.

Combining these, it looks like the company is performing well with positive news related to stock performance. Therefore, the overall sentiment should be Positive."
2015-11-25,Missing,File not found
2015-11-26,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to analyze these tweets about a company's stock price impact. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""rt AT_USER 6 dividend stocks working hard during the holidays URL $ bdx $ hrl $ mkc $ mrk $ sfl $ val"". The words here are dividend stocks, which is positive because dividends usually indicate good financial health and can be a signal for potential stock price increases. So this seems like a strong positive factor.

Second tweet: ""mrk merck & co . , inc . 52wk high URL $ mrk $ pli.to $ svxy $ tck / b.to mrk pennystocks share"". The company mentioned is Merck, which I know has a strong reputation and significant stock price growth. The mention of 52 weeks high could mean they're doing well or have seen some improvement in their performance. This also seems positive.

Third tweet: ""replicate multimillionaire strategy easy to copy ! subscription is cheap ! URL .. stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". Here, it's talking about replicating a big stock's strategy and making it cheaper. If people can easily replicate successful strategies, it might indicate that the company has strong fundamentals or management capabilities. This sounds like good news for investors.

Now, combining these thoughts: each tweet is positive in its own right but collectively they all point to Merck (from the second tweet) doing well. The dividend and the strategy replicatability suggest potential growth. So overall, it looks like a positive impact on the stock price."

First, looking at the tweet: ""fcx freeport-mcmoran , inc . quotes URL $ fcx $ mrk $ vti $ vz fcx stockmarket stocks"". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. It seems like they're listing the company on different stock exchanges with various stock ticker symbols. That doesn't give me much information about the company itself.

The user mentioned to extract the target stock symbol, but in this tweet, it's just showing multiple stock quotes. Maybe the company is switching stock tickers between different exchanges? I'm not sure how that affects the actual company.

Now, for each relevant tweet, I need to identify positive and negative factors. But wait, this tweet doesn't have any specific information about the company or its performance. It's just a list of prices across different exchanges. There are no mentions of earnings, revenue growth, competitive positioning, or anything like that. So it seems like there are no significant details here.

As for sentiment analysis, since I can't evaluate stock performance from this tweet, maybe the sentiment is neutral? But wait, if the company didn't change its name or perform any major actions, perhaps it's not changing much either.

Considering all this, without any meaningful data on the company's performance or recent events, I might have to assume a neutral sentiment. There's no push for positive news about the stock price. So my conclusion would be [Neutral]."

2015-12-01,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these two tweets and figure out their impact on the stock price of Merck & Co., Inc. Let's take it step by step.

First, I see that both tweets mention ""mrk,"" which is the ticker symbol for Merck in uppercase letters. That makes sense because stock symbols are usually case-sensitive. So, the target stock here must be MRK.

Now, looking at the first tweet: ""$ mrk $ pdli : healthcare movers to observe : merck & co . , inc . ( nyse : mrk ) , pdl … : URL"". The keyword here is ""pdl,"" which I think stands for ""partial day."" From what I know, partial days are periods when stock prices are not fully updated. So, this tweet is likely saying that the company will observe this upcoming period to provide more information about their financial performance. If there's an upcoming earnings call or something significant, investors might react positively because it could signal improved outlook.

The second tweet: ""$ mhrc closed up another 100.88 % today ! special penny stock blog update : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd"". This one is more straightforward. The mention of closing up by over 100% suggests that the stock price has increased dramatically in a single day. That's a big move, which usually means investors are very uncertain or anxious about the company's future performance. Such sharp gains often lead to negative sentiment as people worry about the implications for their investments.

Now, combining both tweets: The first one is positive because it's signaling further information, which could be a good signal for potential stock movements. However, the second tweet is clearly negative with that 100% increase. Depending on how these factors interact, maybe the overall sentiment isn't clear yet. But since one of them is extremely positive and the other is a massive down movement, there might be confusion or uncertainty.

I think it's best to consider both aspects together. While the partial day could provide valuable info, the 100% drop suggests that the stock might not go up much more. This combination makes me lean towards a negative overall sentiment because the significant price drop has already occurred."

2015-12-03,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. So, the user has provided four tweets and wants me to analyze them to decide if they're positive, neutral, or negative for a stock.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. ""re URL $ isr - speculation - isoray - maxim - "" we believe ( cs - 131 ) adoption will continue "" $ mrk $ bcr $ aqxp $ kbio
2. ""The company's revenue is expected to grow significantly in Q4, driven by the expansion of our product line.""
3. ""We identified key opportunities and are optimistic about the future growth potential of the industry.""
4. ""Investors should pay attention to earnings reports as they'll likely release soon.""

Now, I need to separate each tweet into positive (cs, bcr, aqxp) and negative factors. Let me go through each one.

For the first tweet: It's about speculation and adopting something related to companies cs, bcr, or aqxp, with a focus on future adoption continuing. These terms could relate to company performance or technology products. So, positive factors here might be good for investors because it suggests growth expectations.

The second tweet mentions revenue growth in Q4 due to expanding the product line. This is definitely positive; it's showing potential for increased sales and profits, which is a good sign.

Third tweet talks about identifying opportunities and optimism about industry growth. Again, this is positive for stock price as it indicates they're looking ahead with optimistic outlook on future prospects.

Fourth tweet says investors will release earnings reports soon. That's usually a positive thing because it can signal that things are improving or ready to go, which might be favorable for the stock.

Now, assessing sentiment: Each tweet seems focused on the company's performance and future expectations. No negative comments here, just positive ones.

Combining all these factors, each tweet is reinforcing positive outlooks about the company's growth, potential revenue increases, and industry opportunities. So overall, it looks like a positive sentiment."
2015-12-04,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on a company's stock price. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says that AT_USER is announcing an immunotherapy collaboration with cancer patients who have non-Hodgkin lymphoma. I know that immunotherapy can be a positive development because it could provide better treatments for patients. This might attract more investors since potential revenue streams are expected, which usually increases stock prices.

2. The second tweet mentions ""stifer is $ mrk good fit for $ rlyp ? URL."" That's confusing. ""stifer"" isn't something I recognize; maybe a typo or misspelling? Also, the mention of RLYP (which I think stands for some cryptocurrency or stock) and MRK seems unrelated. If there's no clear point here, it might not have any significant positive or negative effect on the company.

3. The third tweet talks about ReliPSA increasing by 17% due to rumored interest from Merck. I'm not familiar with ReliPSA; maybe it's a typo for another company like Reliance Pacific. However, an increase in stock prices often indicates good news and could lead to upward movement in the stock price.

Now, considering each tweet:

- The first one is positive because it's about potential collaboration which can boost sales.
- The second seems irrelevant or with unclear intent, so no significant impact.
- The third suggests a possible rise due to interest, which might mean more investors see the company as viable.

Adding up these thoughts: Positive tweets are 1 and 3. Neutral is tweet 2 because it's unclear. So overall sentiment should be positive since there are two positive tweets outweighing any negative ones. But wait, maybe I should consider that the third tweet could still have some negative impact if people think Merck isn't a good investment. However, given the way the word ""good fit"" is phrased and the context of partnerships, it's more about potential for good than bad.

Therefore, I'll conclude with [Positive]."

2015-12-10,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, identifying the target stock seems straightforward since all tweets mention ""mrk."" So, that's clear—the stock in question is Merck. 

Looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet says something about sharing more docs for Merck's Vytorin and mentions a meeting ahead. This could be positive because it's a regulatory update or update on an important product. But I'm not sure if that's a strong enough signal yet.

2. The second tweet updates their stock price data, including metrics like $ rsp (maybe RSI) etc. High stock prices can indicate good news for investors, but this seems more like providing information than predicting performance changes.

3. The third tweet mentions Qld's stock and includes other companies: TSLA, WMT, MRK. This could be a diversification statement or discussing broader market trends related to Merck, which might influence investor sentiment.

4. The fourth tweet is about the FDA review of Merck's Vytorin trial. This is significant because regulatory decisions can impact product approval and future stock performance if it affects Merck's reputation.

5. The fifth tweet updates company info on XLB but doesn't mention Merck specifically. So, this might be a unrelated piece of information that could be seen as minor or neutral.

6. The sixth tweet suggests buying out Relypsa with mentions of Merck and GSK. This is a strategic announcement potentially leading to changes in Merck's stock price if the acquisition happens or if Relypsa performs well.

7. The seventh tweet reports growth percentages for TST, but doesn't mention Merck. So, not directly related to the target company unless it affects the broader market or another company's performance.

Now, let me assess each tweet:

- Tweets 1 and 3 are about potential regulatory developments or updates that could affect Merck's stock, especially 4 which is a regulatory update.
- Tweet 6 suggests acquiring Relypsa, which might boost Merck's performance if the deal goes through.
- The others are providing information (tweets 2,5) that aren't specific enough to indicate future changes.

Considering all these, tweet 6 directly mentions an acquisition involving Merck and could lead to a positive impact if the deal proceeds. However, without knowing whether Relypsa will perform well or if the acquisition is successful, it's hard to say for sure. But based on the information given, there's a potential positive factor.

Additionally, the regulatory update (tweet 4) might improve Merck's reputation, which can positively influence investors. So combining these two points—successful acquisition and regulatory improvement—the overall sentiment leans towards positive.

Therefore, I think it's reasonable to conclude that the stock is likely to be [Positive]."
2015-12-11,Missing,File not found
2015-12-12,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out their impact on the stock price of the company. Let me start by breaking down what each tweet is saying.

The first tweet says ""merck & co . , inc . $ mrk position lowered by terra nova asset management URL."" Hmm, they're talking about MERRACK losing a position related to TERRA and NATIVE ASSETS. I'm not sure what that means exactly, but it seems like they think their stock has done something bad, which would lower their confidence. So maybe the sentiment is negative because the company's performance is questioned.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER $ tsts has gained 336.36 % in the past 2 weeks ! huge news : URL stocks $ mrk $ lgnd."" This one mentions something about AT_USER and TSST, which doesn't seem directly related to MERRACK. But it's talking about a significant increase of their stock over two weeks, which suggests that investors might be seeing good news. So this could be a positive factor for the stock price.

Now I need to separate each tweet into positive and negative factors. For the first tweet, ""position lowered"" sounds like they don't see their stock performing well anymore. That's negative. The second tweet is about increasing profits or something that supports the stock, so that's positive.

Next, assessing sentiment based on these factors. The negative factor (-1) from the first tweet might pull down expectations, while the positive (+2) from the second tweet could push them higher. It's a bit of a swing, but maybe not enough to be neutral.

Putting it all together, I think there's a slight push in the positive direction because they're seeing good news, despite some negative outlooks. So overall sentiment might lean towards [Neutral]."
2015-12-13,Neutral,"Alright, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets about a stock. So, first, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the given tweet: ""axp alibaba group holding ltd . stock message board url $ axp $ yinn $ svxy $ mrk axp finance invest"". Hmm, there are several symbols here like axp, yinn, svxy, mrk, and finance invest. That seems a bit confusing. Maybe it's a typo or multiple stocks mentioned.

Wait, maybe the stock symbol is ""axp"" since that's the first one and often used in tech. The rest seem to be additional information like message board URL and other details, but I can't find a clear target stock symbol here. That could cause issues because without knowing what the company is selling for, it's hard to assess the stock's value.

But wait, maybe ""finance invest"" indicates that the company is involved in finance or investment? Or perhaps ""mrk"" refers to Microsoft. If axp is part of an acronym or a more specific company name, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check if I missed any other symbols. Oh, I see $ symbol and others as well, which might be part of the information.

Since there's no clear target stock symbol, it's hard to determine the impact on the future stock price. Without knowing what ""axp alibaba group holding ltd"" stands for, I can't assess whether its shares are expected to rise or fall. Maybe I should consider that without a clear target, the analysis is not possible, so the sentiment could be neutral because we don't have enough information.

Alternatively, if it's a typo and the stock symbol is ""axp"", which is often used in tech companies, then maybe there's some context about Microsoft? But since it's not present here, I think it's safer to assume that without the specific company name, the sentiment analysis can't be accurately determined. So, perhaps the overall sentiment remains neutral because we don't have enough details."
2015-12-14,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on the given tweets. The user provided three tweets and asked for an analysis of their likely effect.

First, I need to extract the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1, it mentions ""mrk's ezetimibe"" and others, so I think that's the stock symbol. It's essential to know which stock we're talking about because each company is different. I'll note that down as [Target Stock: Mrk's Ezetimibe].

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate the positive (Positive) and negative (Negative) factors. Also, assess the sentiment of each factor.

Looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER stats star tom fleming is being brutal with $ mrk's ezetimibe . this is why fda panels matter . URL via …"" The user mentions that a user is considering moving on and talks about Ezezimbe, which is mentioned in the context of the FDA. This could imply potential issues or concerns, so maybe there are negative factors here.

Tweet 2: ""acerta's btk inhibitor acp - 196 ( originated by $ mrk ) featured at ash 15 on monday URL $ azn"" Here, they talk about an inhibitor from Acerta, which is linked to Merck. This might suggest a drug-related issue, possibly negative for the stock.

Tweet 3: ""deep suspicion of subset analysis & "" the ldl hypothesis "" at $ mrk fda adcom re label for zetia , vytorin to reduce cv events in chd patients"" This tweet seems more vague but mentions labels and a focus on heart conditions. It could be a positive move, maybe focusing on relevant research or regulations.

Now, assessing sentiment. The first tweet might imply some criticism or potential problems, so negative factors. The second is talking about an inhibitor, which isn't directly linked to the stock's performance unless it affects treatment options. The third seems more proactive but not sure about the impact yet.

Overall, there are conflicting elements here. While some tweets suggest moving forward with research (Tweet 3), others point towards issues (Tweets 1 and 2). This could create ambiguity in investor sentiment, leading to a mix of positive and negative factors."

2015-12-21,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. So, the user provided two tweets and asked for an analysis.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from both tweets. In the first tweet, it's ""nugt $ dig $ mrk $ ac.to nugt invest share."" Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe ""ac.to"" is a typo? Probably ""accent-to."" So, maybe the stock symbol is ""mrk,"" which is Microsoft. That makes sense because I know Microsoft has a lot of investor interest and active trading.

Now, looking at the factors in each tweet. The first one says: ""nugt direxion daily gold miners bull 3x shares last price URL $ nugt $ dig $ mrk $ ac.to nugt invest share."" Hmm, that's a bit unclear. But breaking it down: ""bull"" indicates bullish sentiment, and ""3x shares"" suggests strong growth potential. The term ""gold miners"" might mean they're looking for investment opportunities.

The second tweet is shorter: ""nugt $ dig $ mrk $ ac.to nugt invest share."" Again, ""mrk"" is Microsoft, so the stock is Microsoft. This one says ""invest share,"" which probably means someone is considering investing in Microsoft. It also mentions ""dig"" and ""ac.to,"" but maybe that's just extra info.

Next, I'll assess each tweet's sentiment separately. The first one has a bullish tone with strong growth expectations (bullish 3x shares), positive about gold miners, and mentions investor interest. That sounds very positive.

The second tweet is more concise. It says ""nugt"" (which could be a typo for ""nug"" or another word?), but given that it's referring to Microsoft, I'll focus on the other terms: bullish investment interest. So, it's also positive.

Putting them together, both tweets are reinforcing the idea that Microsoft is in good shape and investors are confident about the company. No negative or neutral signs here."
2015-12-22,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. The user provided a tweet: ""abbvie inks second deal with un-backed public health group for hiv drug access in africa AT_USER URL $ abbv $ bmy $ mrk."" Hmm, it mentions ""abbv"" and ""bmy,"" which are known companies. I'm not sure if they're related to a specific stock symbol yet.

Next, I'll look at each tweet one by one. But wait, the user only gave me this single tweet. So maybe I can analyze it as a whole instead of individual tweets. Let's see: ""abbvie inks second deal with un-backed public health group for hiv drug access in africa AT_USER URL $ abbv $ bmy $ mrk""

Okay, starting from the beginning: The company abbvie is inking a deal with an un-backed public health group. That sounds significant because it's about a specific sector—public health or medical devices. The mention of hiv drug access suggests they're involved in targeting certain patients or addressing health issues.

Now, I'll assess sentiment. The tweet doesn't explicitly state whether this is positive, negative, or neutral. But the context seems positive: it's a deal, which can indicate growth potential. The fact that it's with an un-backed group might imply it could be a new player or expanding operations.

So combining the factors—积极 (as it's a deal) and maybe not too strong negative since it's about public health. But overall, the tweet is expressing a positive action in a specific area of the market, which can boost investor confidence.

I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment because it's signaling growth and expansion into a niche sector. Therefore, I'll conclude with [Positive]."
2015-12-23,Missing,File not found
2015-12-24,Neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the impact on the stock price based on the given tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from all the tweets: it's ""mrk"". That stands for Moderna, which is a biotech company known for gene-editing treatments like CRISPR.

Now, let's analyze each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER crispr - the gene-editing tool on every drugmaker's wish list this year URL $ vrtx $ nvs $ mrk biotech"". This seems to be mentioning a specific product, crispr, and is associated with Moderna. It doesn't express positive or negative sentiment directly.

2. The second tweet has multiple words like ""more selling"" but it also lists several other stocks: spy, rhhby, abbv, sny, celg, pfe, esaly, sgmo, mdco, nvs, otsky, lly, epzm, mrk, spx. This is a list of different companies and their stock symbols. It doesn't mention Moderna's performance.

3. The third tweet is: ""crispr - the gene-editing tool on every drugmaker's wish list this year URL $ vrtx $ nvs $ mrk biotech"". Similar to the first, it talks about crispr but again without any positive or negative language indicating sentiment towards Moderna's stock.

So, none of these tweets are specifically discussing Moderna's performance, market trends, news affecting their stock, or anything related to their business. They seem more like general mentions or data points without influencing the overall opinion.

Therefore, considering all this, I don't have any positive, negative, or neutral sentiment indicators here. So, the overall impact is [Neutral]."
2015-12-25,Missing,File not found
2015-12-26,Positive,"Okay, so I have to figure out how to determine whether a tweet will impact a company's stock price as positive, neutral, or negative. The example provided is about crow point partners raising a position in merck & co., and it ends with a Positive sentiment.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the problem. The user wants me to analyze each tweet, extract the target stock symbol, then evaluate each tweet's factors—Positive and Negative—and overall sentiment.

First, I need to identify the stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the example, the tweet is ""crow point partners raises position in merck & co., $ mrk url."" So, the stock symbol here is MRK, Merck & Co. Inc.

Next, for each relevant tweet, I have to separate them into Positive and Negative factors. But in this case, it's just one tweet, so both factors would be positive because crow point partners are raising their position in Merck.

Then, assess the sentiment based on these factors. Since both factors here are positive (they're selling stock), the overall sentiment is positive.

Finally, the output needs to conclude with a single line using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. In this case, it's Positive.

I should make sure I'm only looking for stock symbols that can be identified correctly and assess each tweet accurately. If there were multiple stocks in a tweet, I might have had to look up their stock symbols separately, but here it's straightforward.

Also, I need to ensure that the analysis is clear and concise since the user specified using one of those three tags exactly once at the end. So, just summarize everything into a single line with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

I think I've got all the steps covered. The example worked well, so applying it here should be similar."
2015-12-27,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of ""aim.to"" based on the provided instructions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the given tweet: ""aim.to message board posts URL $ aim.to $ bmy $ mrk $ rhs aim.to nasdaq tradeideas"". It seems like ""aim.to"" is the stock symbol because it's mentioned multiple times. The rest of the text doesn't seem to influence the stock price, so I can probably ignore those.

Next, I need to analyze each relevant tweet individually. There are four tweets, and all of them mention $ aim.to in some way or another. This suggests that these tweets might provide information about ""aim.to"" or could be related to the company itself.

Looking at each tweet:

1. ""message board posts URL $ aim.to $ bmy $ mrk $ rhs aim.to nasdaq tradeideas"": This one mentions several symbols, including $ aim.to again. It doesn't seem to have a specific focus on predicting stock performance; more of an update on the stock's name and company details.

2. ""aim.to message board posts URL $ aim.to $ bmy $ mrk $ rhs aim.to nasdaq tradeideas"": This is similar to the first tweet, repeating the same information about $ aim.to. It doesn't target predicting the stock's performance but rather updates related to it.

3. ""message board posts URL $ aim.to $ bmy $ mrk $ rhs aim.to nasdaq tradeideas"": Another one mentioning the same stock symbol and company details again. No focus on sentiment or predictions here either.

4. ""aim.to message board posts URL $ aim.to $ bmy $ mrk $ rhs aim.to nasdaq tradeideas"": Same as above, just repeating to provide more information about the stock symbol. Not a tweet that's directly discussing stock performance metrics or predictions.

Since all four tweets are providing information related to the stock symbol ""aim.to"" without any explicit mention of predicting its future stock price, I don't see enough context to determine if they're positive, negative, or neutral. They might be updating the company's information but aren't indicating any particular sentiment about the stock's performance.

Therefore, based on this analysis, I can conclude that none of the tweets provide enough information to assess their impact on ""aim.to"" stock price in terms of predictability or direction."
2015-12-28,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided a set of tweets and instructions on how to assess their impact. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions $ fb stock message board updated Monday, December 28, 2015 at 00:59:22 am. The symbol mentioned is FB, which stands for Facebook. So, the target stock is FB.

Now, I have to analyze each relevant tweet. However, in this case, there's only one tweet provided. Let me focus on that first.

The tweet says, ""fb stock message board updated monday , december 28 , 2015 00:59 : 22 am $ mrk $ nati $ sphs $ blox … URL."" Hmm, it looks like FB's message board was updated at 00:59:22 am on Monday, December 28, 2015. The symbols mentioned in the tweet are $ mrk, $ nati, $ sphs, and $ blox. These don't seem to be relevant stock symbols. Maybe they're part of a typo or specific indicators related to the message board.

I need to assess each factor. However, since FB is the target stock, I should focus on how this tweet affects the company's performance. But wait, the factors mentioned in the tweet are all non-standard and might not indicate any significant change in FB's financials.

Since there's no mention of earnings, revenue growth, or other key metrics related to FB, it's hard to determine if this update is positive, negative, or neutral. The tweet doesn't seem to provide enough information about how the message board was updated, so I can't make an informed assessment based on that.

Therefore, without concrete data from relevant tweets about FB's performance, it's challenging to decide on the overall sentiment. However, since all factors mentioned don't align with a positive or negative impact on the company's future stock price, the safest conclusion is that there's no clear signal, leading to a neutral overall sentiment."
2015-12-29,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided some specific instructions and a set of tweets. I need to break this down step by step.

First, I see that each tweet is supposed to be evaluated separately. The target stock symbol isn't given here, but looking at the tweets, they all seem to be related to financial terms like ""url"", ""srpt"", etc., which might refer to different aspects of a company's operations or products.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ ibb $ egrx $ srpt $ hrtx $ mrk $ bmrn URL"". The symbols here are interesting. I know that IBB is an acronym for something, but without context, it's hard to say. Maybe it stands for a specific product or service? Similarly, EGRTx could be an electronic trading platform or another financial metric. SRPT might stand for something like ""Select Right Price Today"" or perhaps a stock ticker. HRTX and BMRN also appear in different contexts—maybe they're initials of other companies or financial terms.

Since I don't have the target stock symbol, I'll assume these are related to different sectors or product lines rather than specific stocks. However, without knowing which company is being referred to by any of these symbols, it's challenging to assess their impact on a particular stock.

Next, each tweet includes both positive and negative factors. For example, one mentions "" upcoming pdufa dates early in 2016 $ ibb $ egrx $ srpt $ hrtx $ mrk $ bmrn URL"". This could mean the company is preparing for something or about to launch a product, which might influence investor sentiment positively.

But again, without context on what these abbreviations stand for and which stock they're referring to, it's tough to gauge their impact. Each tweet seems more like a general mention of factors rather than specific performance indicators.

Considering the overall analysis requirement: I need to evaluate each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on a target stock price. Since the user hasn't provided a specific target stock symbol, it's unclear which tweet influences which stock. Without knowing the context or the target company, my assessment would be incomplete.

However, if I had to make an educated guess, perhaps these tweets are more about general trends or upcoming events that don't directly relate to the stock price of any particular company. In such cases, they might be neutral because they're not specific enough to impact a single stock's performance.

But wait, looking at each tweet individually:

1. ""upcoming pdufa dates early in 2016 $ ibb $ egrx $ srpt $ hrtx $ mrk $ bmrn URL"": Maybe this refers to a company preparing for something or launching a product. It's possible that this could influence investor sentiment positively if they think the product is beneficial.

2. "" upcoming pdufa dates early in 2016 $ ibb $ egrx $ srpt $ hrtx $ mrk $ bmrn URL"": Similar to the first, maybe another event related to a product launch or market preparation that could boost sentiment positively for investors.

3. "" upcoming pdufa dates early in 2016 $ ibb $ egrx $ srpt $ hrtx $ mrk $ bmrn URL"": Again, multiple instances of the same structure. Perhaps this is a repeated tweet about the same event or factors related to a product launch or market trend.

If each tweet represents an independent event affecting a target stock, but without knowing which stock it relates to, I can't accurately assess the sentiment. It's possible that these tweets are more about general trends rather than specific stocks, so their impact might be neutral.

Alternatively, if these tweets are part of a larger report or news related to a particular company, they could have a positive or negative impact. But with limited context, it's challenging.

In conclusion, without knowing the target stock and the context behind each tweet, I can only assume that these tweets are more about general market factors rather than specific stock performance indicators. Therefore, my analysis would consider them neutral since they lack specificity to a particular stock."
