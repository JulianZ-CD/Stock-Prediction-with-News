Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets about the stock price of Apple Inc., specifically the stock symbol
AALP or AAPL. My task is to determine whether each tweet has a positive, negative, or neutral impact on the
company's future stock price.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one and break them down into factors. Each tweet can have positive or
negative sentiments. After analyzing all the tweets, I need to see how these individual signals add up and what
they mean for the overall market sentiment towards Apple.

Let me start with the first few tweets:

1. "$ aapl - wall st . kicks off new year on lower note -> URL stock stocks stockaction": This seems like just a
placeholder URL. It doesn't provide any meaningful information about the company, so I'll assume it's neutral.

2. "rt AT_USER here's how apple could be making a huge push into healthcare --> URL $ aapl": This tweet is
encouraging Apple to expand into healthcare, which might affect their stock price. The positive aspect of this
could lead to an upward sentiment.

3. "rt AT_USER our top 3 trade ideas for 2014 and two $ 1,000 futures wins already in the bank $ gld $ uso $ aapl
- - URL": This seems like it's advising Apple to invest heavily in futures, which could impact their stock price
positively through diversification or other benefits.

4. "AT_USER $ aapl having breathing difficulties": Here, the tweet is stating that the stock is struggling with
some issue—breathing difficulties—but there's no clear correlation to the stock's performance. It might be seen
as speculative but not necessarily positive or negative.

5. "emylers : cheeky's board ! : $ aapl up to date company activities and other important things URL": This tweet
seems to focus on the company's current state, which doesn't directly relate to their future performance. Still,
it's just commentary without any information about their stock price impact.

6. "$ aapl blackberry and singer alicia keys to part ways URL": This is a news item that might affect Apple's
product development or marketing, which in turn could influence the stock. It introduces a negative factor as Apple is moving on previous partnerships.

7. "$ aapl - chinas xiaomi says to more than double smartphone sales in 2014 -> URL stock stocks stockaction": This tweet suggests that China's growth might impact Apple's
smartphone sales, which are major constituents of their portfolio. Negative news could reduce the stock price negatively.

8. "rt AT_USER our top 3 trade ideas for 2014 and two $ 1,000 futures wins already in the bank $ gld $ uso $ aapl - - URL": Similar to tweet 3, this is advising on
investments that might positively impact the stock through diversification.

9. "rt AT_USER our top 3 trade ideas for 2014 and two $ 1,000 futures wins already in the bank $ gld $ uso $ aapl - - URL": Again, similar advice as tweet 8, indicating
potential positive effects on Apple's stock from diversification.

10. "what are your top picks for q1 2014 ? here are mine : $ aapl $ cree $ fb $ cldx $ sne": This is just asking for recommendations without any discussion of the company's
performance or market reactions, so it's neutral.

11. "rt AT_USER our top 3 trade ideas for 2014 and two $ 1,000 futures wins already in the bank $ gld $ uso $ aapl - - URL": Similar to tweets 8-9; positive trades could
influence stock price positively.

12. "$ aapl us stocks-wall st kicks off new year on lower note URL": This is another placeholder, so it's neutral. It doesn't provide any specific information about the
company's performance.

13. "rt AT_USER apple gained 8 % in 2013 vs s & p's 30 % but don't cry for $ aapl investors . at least some hope URL": Apple did slightly better than the S&P 500 in 2013,
which is positive news that could give some hope to shareholders. This seems like a moderate positive sentiment.

14. "this weeks $ aapl 550 puts are already up a dollar today .": This mentions options trading but doesn't directly impact the stock price positively or negatively; it's
just a market comment without specific information on Apple's performance.

15. "thursday headlines include news on $ cpb , $ nyt , $ aapl , $ wmt and $ nflx URL": These are individual news items, each about different companies. None mention any of
Apple's stock performance, so this tweet is neutral or speculative.

Now, compiling the sentiment analysis:

- Positive tweets: 2 (tellers encouraging expansion into healthcare and investments)
- Neutral tweets: 15 (tweets like placeholders, general market commentary without info on Apple, etc.)
- Negative tweets: 8 (tweets about China's growth impacting smartphone sales)

The positive tweets are two in number. However, I need to consider that the other positive tweet is just a suggestion for investment, which might not directly cause an
impact but could influence shares through diversification.

Looking at the overall trend, there are a mix of negative and positive signals. The strong positive tweet (3) suggests Apple's expansion into healthcare could positively
affect their stock. However, the negative tweet (7) about China's growth in smartphones is significant because a major component of Apple's portfolio, which can reduce
demand.

The neutral tweets include several that focus on general market conditions or individual news items unrelated to Apple. The positive investments (8-9) suggest
diversification benefits, but it's not clear if this directly affects the company's performance.

Considering all these, the overall sentiment seems mixed because there are both encouraging and negative factors. However, the strong positive tweet indicates a potential
upward push from expanding into new markets or products.
